**MF Ratios**
* SIP Future Value ,  S = R((1+i)^n-1/i) (1+i) , 1,000 each month 10 years(120), 15% pa , 15/12 = 1.25% = 0.0125 , 
* S = 1,000 * [{(1+ 0.0125) ^120 - 1}/0.0125] *  (1+ 0.0125)  = Rs 2,78,657
* ALPHA : fund's risk-adjusted return. + alpha fund better than expected, a negative alpha the fund has underperformed.
* BETA : volatility returns relative mkt index. beta 1.3 , Nifty rises 1%, stock +13%; index falls 1%, -13% , higher beta -> high risk investment.
* Sharpe Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfoli volatility (v)
* Treynor Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfoli beta (b)




## TVM 
**TVM Fx**
- PV (rate, nper, pmt, fv, type)
- FV , PV , Rate of Int % , Duration (N years) , PMT , 

**NPV ,Some points to note**
1. NPV is an absolute number
2. IRR is expressed in % terms
3. NPV calculates additional wealth
4. IRR reflects investment performance as well as cash flows
5. Use of IRR facilitates comparison
6. NPV and IRR both are discounted cash flow models
7. Since NPV is a direct measure of increase in wealth, NPV is preferred over IRR in case of conflict in mutually exclusive investments (where we have to select only one investment). In case of a scenario like: A’s NPV is high & B’s IRR is high, always go with the higher NPV option.

**Ratios**
- Payback period = Initial investment amount/value ÷ Cash flow per year
- Payback period = Initial investment amount/value ÷ Cash flow per year
- Solvency ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities , Ideally, the ratio should be more than 1
- Liquidity Ratio = Total liquid assets/Total current debt , The value should be above one. 
- Liquidity Ratio = Total liquid assets\Total current debt , value of this ratio should ideally be above one. 
- Savings Ratio = Savings / Gross Income , target 20% savings rate,
- Debt to income r : Monthly Debt Payment / Monthly Income 15000(emi)/50000(sal) DTI : 30% , DTI < 30% ( to get a loan)
- HPR=(EV-BV/BV) *100
- Total return = (EV - BV)/ BV *100

**Inflation**
- Inflation : Future amount = Present amount * (1+inflation rate) ^number of years , = 10,000* (1+5%) ^10 = 16,289
- Purchasing Power , Future Value = Present value/(1+inflation rate)^number of years ,  =10,000/ (1+5%) ^10 = 6,139

**Compound Interest** 
- Formula: A = P * (1+r/t) ^ (nt) , Total amount you will receive after 10 years will be  = 1,00,000(1+0.1) ^10 = 2,59,374.25

**XIRR**
- XIRR (B14:B15,A14:a15) , 
- 01-Jan-2010 , -10000
- 01-Jan-2012 , 12000

**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**
- indicate the return on an investment over a period. 
- best tool to compare returns of two different asset classes - for instance gold/equity or equity/real estate. 
- Formula:  CAGR=((FV/PV)^(1/n)) - 1
- Suppose that an investment of Rs 1,000 grows to Rs 5,000 in 10 years.
- CAGR is ((5,000/1,000)^(1/10)) - 1 , This comes to 17.4 per cent, 
- ((20,000/10,000) ^(1/2)) - 1, the CAGR comes to 41.42 per cent.

**Effective Annual Rate** 
- Formula: Effective Annual Rate = (1+(r/n))^n)-1*100
- If an investment is made at 9 per cent annual rate and compounding is done quarterly, 
- the effective annual rate will be (1+(0.09/4)^4) -1*100  = 9.3 per cent
- Inflation adjusted returns = [(1+ r) / (1+P)}-1]*100, where r is nominal , return and P is inflation rate
- Tax Adjusted returns TR = NR * (1-tax rate), where TR: tax adjusted return and NR: nominal return
- Post Tax Return ,  = Interest rate - (Interest rate*tax rate)  = 10-(10*30%) = 7


**Mutual Funds**
- Sharpe Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfolio volatility (v)
- Treynor Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfolio beta (b)
- Jensen Ratio (S) = R (actual portfolio return) – SML (expected return)
- SML= Rf+ ß (Rm- Rf), where Rf is risk free return, ß is portfolio beta , and Rm is market return.

**Future Value of SIP** 
- Formula: S = R((1+i)^n-1/i) (1+i)
- S = Future value of investment ,   R = Regular monthly investment  , i = Interest rate assumed /12
- n = Duration (number of months or number of years *12) investing Rs 1,000 each month for the next 10 years and expect a return of 15 per cent. Monthly over next 10 years = 12*10 = 120 months
- Interest: 15% per annum - 15/12 = 1.25% = 0.0125
- S = 1,000 * [{(1+ 0.0125) ^120 - 1}/0.0125] *  (1+ 0.0125)  = Rs 2,78,657, which is the future value of the SIP.


**How much we need** 
* Future cost= a* (1+r) ^ n | = 1200000 * ( 1+7% ) ^ 15 = 33 10 838  , 7 % inflation , 15 yr child edu, Current Val 12l
* How much to invest = PMT (RATE, NPER, PV, FV, Type) | = PMT( 12%/12 , 15.12 , 0 , 33 10 838)

**Loan EMI** 
- Formula: EMI= (A*R)*(1+R) ^N/ ((1+R) ^N)-1) ,  A = Loan amount ,  R = Interest rate N= Duration
- Suppose you have taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh at 11 per cent annual interest for 15 years.
- 1 per cent per annum translates into 11/1200 = 0.00916 per month , Tenure = 15*12 = 180 months
- EMI = (1000000 x 0.00916) x ((1+.00916) ^180) / ([(1+.00916) ^180] - 1)  = = Rs 11,361

**Loan(Home,Car)**
* EMI Formula: EMI= (A*R)*(1+R) ^N/ ((1+R) ^N)-1)
* loan 10l ,11%,15 years ,Tenure = 15*12 = 180 months , EMI = (1000000 x 0.00916)x((1+.00916)^180)/([(1+.00916) ^180] - 1)  = = Rs 11,361 





## CFP
**CFP book notes**
* A picture is worth 1000 words , Similarly, your financial journey can be managed effectively with a single piece of paper.
* A fundamental tenet of this book is simple: every day, when you wake up, your primary goal should be to increase your assets and net worth-with clear intent and in a measurable way.
* **Watch the pennies , and the dollars will take care of themselves**
* Joe's tenacity in squeezing every penny out of everything-both on the expense side and the revenue side- while steadily increasing his net worth.
* What Joe practiced daily was the belief that daily actions determine your level of success. Everything else, he felt, was nonsense. Financial planning, he'd say, is first about what you do today , not about fancy planning for tomorrow , he became passionate about getting anywhere from 1$ to 10000$ under his control daily , weekly and monthly , this will NOT be easy , (mission to secure daily bread and pray to God constantly)
* Financial planning , of course is about more than just money , First you must simplify and plan daily , weekly , monthly and yearly.
Brick by brick , conserve dollars , and earn dollars. once you start doing this , things change.
* **The Daily Discipline of Saving Wealth** is built not in giant leaps but through daily habits. Saving every day-whether it's $1, $10, or $100-is an act of self-discipline and belief in your future. Over time, these small efforts compound, leading to significant results.
* Clarity on Financial Goals : The first step in changing your financial mindset is understanding why you want to improve your financial
situation. This "why" becomes the backbone of your One-Page Plan. (a) What do you want your financial life to look like
in 5, 10, or 20 years? (b) What are your top priorities: paying off debt, buying a home, saving for retirement, or starting a business?
* If the goal is to save $50,000 in five years, that breaks down to $833 per month.
* If you want to pay off $10,000 in debt, create a monthly payment plan that fits into your budget.
* Track Progress and Adjust : The key to keeping your financial mindset strong is tracking progress. A one-page financial plan should include space to monitor your milestones. Regularly review how much you've saved, how much debt you've paid off, and whether you are staying within your budget. Seeing tangible progress builds confidence and reinforces the belief that change is possible.

SOURCES OF ‘POST RETIREMENT’ INCOME
- Savings and retirement proceeds from investments;

On the other hand, over long periods, equity has the potential to beat inflation,whereas debt may provide less than inflation returns after taxes.
That is why, a predominantly debt portfolio is recommended for near term goals, a balanced portfolio for medium term goals and a predominantly equity portfolio for long to very long-term goals.
Asset Allocation is also important because it is not possible to be invested in the best asset class at all times. Whereas the occasional rewards could be huge, the cost of a mistake could be very large.
