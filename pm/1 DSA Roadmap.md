Got it—you want to nail DSA by focusing on the 20 % of concepts that deliver 80 % of the results. Here’s a quick “80/20” cheat sheet:

*Core topics (≈20 % of DSA)*
- *Arrays & Strings* – sliding window, two‑pointer, prefix sums
- *Linked Lists* – fast/slow pointers, reversal, cycle detection
- *Stacks & Queues* – monotonic stack, BFS/DFS basics
- *Trees* – binary tree traversals, BST operations, depth‑first recursion
- *Graphs* – BFS/DFS, topological sort, shortest‑path (Dijkstra/BFS)
- *Recursion & Backtracking* – permutations, subsets, N‑Queens pattern
- *Dynamic Programming* – classic 1‑D/2‑D DP, knapsack, longest‑increasing subsequence
- *Sorting & Searching* – quicksort/merge sort, binary search variants
- *Hashing* – frequency maps, two‑sum pattern, handling collisions

*How to use the 80/20 rule*
1. *Pick one core topic* and solve 5–6 “signature” problems that cover all its patterns.
2. *Generalize*: after each problem, write a one‑sentence “template” you can reuse.
3. *Rotate*: spend a week on each topic, then revisit with mixed‑topic sets to cement connections.
4. *Time‑box*: 30 min to solve, 15 min to review the optimal solution—focus on the idea, not just the code.

*Quick starter plan (2 weeks)*
- *Day 1‑2:* Arrays & Strings – sliding window, two‑pointer.
- *Day 3‑4:* Linked Lists – reversal, cycle detection.
- *Day 5‑6:* Stacks/Queues – monotonic stack, BFS basics.
- *Day 7‑8:* Trees – inorder traversal, BST insert/search.
- *Day 9‑10:* Graphs – BFS/DFS, topological sort.
- *Day 11‑12:* Recursion – subsets, permutations.
- *Day 13‑14:* DP – knapsack, LIS, edit distance.

Finish each day with a one‑sentence summary of the pattern you learned. That repetition is the “20 % effort” that yields the “80 % payoff.”

## Qs System Design
**Steps on Tackling a System Design Interview**
* Ask as many questions as possible to get a clear understanding of the requirements.
* Write them down the main use cases on the whiteboard.
* Ask re-clarifying and scope related questions.
* Once you have reqs written down draw up a flow diagram with various components and how they are connected and talk about the possible use cases.
* Think out loud. Verify your assumptions with the interviewer.
* Be prepared to write up the APIs specs for the flows and split the applications down by features.
* Also, you would need to have a fair understanding of various types of databases. When do you use RDBMS vs NoSQL? 
* When do you use a message queue? Which type of queue would you use?
* Detailing what kind of cache you would use and where.
* Talk about scaling, Redundancy, DR.
