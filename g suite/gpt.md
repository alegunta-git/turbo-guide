## gpt usage issues in studies
"gave a science worksheet to my students here. It is absolutely possible to simply screenshot and upload this to ChatGPT, and get all the answers, and I am sure many of the students do it."

"Students are using AI tools for nearly all aspects of their academic life—doing homework, assignments, creating PPTs, ideating for projects, getting clarity on difficult concepts where teachers may not have the time to explain, and learning alternative ways to solve problems.

“For our holiday homework, my bench partner used ChatGPT to prepare the history of warriors. She copied the answer word-to-word. She used difficult words that were very difficult. The teacher found out and asked her the meaning of those words, which she did not know,” said Prachi, a Class 8 student at a CBSE school in Ghaziabad, giggling."

"Meanwhile, teachers too can use AI tools in multiple ways—creating assignments, coming up with ideas for class activities, writing recommendation letters, or letters to parents, and explaining the academic grades for the child, among other things. While teachers are catching up with the developments themselves, some schools have introduced training to help teachers learn to use the models more effectively for teaching.

“Teachers have taken workshops about new tools that we could use. There is gamma AI for presentations. Of course, ChatGPT has always been there. Using ChatGPT, they can just upload the data, upload any document or a PDF, and generate a quiz from there, and generate questions, and give answers. It’s a lot easier for the teachers because we need to produce so many worksheets.” 


**Jennifer Allan, a 35-year-old realtor and content creator based in Delaware, told Newsweek that despite earning well, she had long struggled with financial management. “Not because I don’t make enough, but because I was never taught financial literacy,” she said**

"Seeking a change, she turned to ChatGPT for a 30-day personal finance challenge. Each day, she used the AI tool to suggest one actionable step toward reducing her debt, whether by brainstorming side hustles, cancelling unused subscriptions, or identifying unused funds in forgotten accounts.


The AI’s suggestions were simple but effective
One task prompted her to comb through finance apps and bank accounts, where she discovered over $10,000 ( ₹8.5 lakh) in unclaimed money, including in a dormant brokerage account. On another day, she created a pantry-only meal plan, reducing her monthly grocery bill by nearly ₹50,000.

Allan now plans to launch a second 30-day challenge to eliminate the rest. “It wasn’t some big financial hack,” she said. “It was the act of facing it every day, of tracking it, talking about it, looking at it. I stopped being afraid of my numbers.”
