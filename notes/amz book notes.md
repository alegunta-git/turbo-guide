**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway.  Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end. It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary
