**How to crack NEET**
1. **Remember for competitive exam, time is limited and one can't afford to waste it here and there.(8am to 10pm)**
1. Study Schedule , Study plan , freq revision session, Solve numerical pbm , draw diagram , mnemonics 
1. PYQ :check hidden info , eliminate incorrect option, Id weak area , review mistakes 
1. Skim entire q paper, prioritize qs , id easy qs , Skip difficult qs initially , use shortcuts approx , avoid overthinking second guessing 
1. There is none who can pay you for your hours spent sitting on table and chair with the book.
1. _You will be only paid for the pages read and remembered and that too pages selected carefully and not interestingly_.
1. If a person selects one subject and read all the books written on one subject, he can not clear a competitive exam. 
1. Rather who can remember physics/chemistry 60/60% and biology 80 per- cent will get better rank.
1. If you are not able to understand something just cram or leave it , you are not supposed to do research(rca fail : overenthusiasm)

## 20 tips for reading college textbook, 
**Before Reading (Survey & Question)**
organized by the steps of the reading process (often referred to as a variation of the SQ3R or P2R method)
1.  **Read the Chapter Summary First:** Get the "big picture" and the main conclusions the author wants you to reach *before* diving into the details.
2.  **Turn Headings into Questions:** Convert chapter titles and section headings into *Who, What, Why, or How* questions. This gives you a clear purpose for reading.
    * *Example:* "The Cell Membrane Structure" becomes "What is the structure of the cell membrane?"
3.  **Preview All Visuals:** Examine charts, graphs, diagrams, and photos. Read the captions. These visuals often represent key concepts or processes that will be on an exam.
4.  **Skim the Introduction and Conclusion:** This provides context and highlights the most essential themes.
5.  **Review End-of-Chapter Questions:** Know what information you'll be expected to recall or apply. Read the chapter specifically looking for the answers to those questions.
6.  **Assess Your Prior Knowledge:** Briefly recall and jot down what you already know about the topic. This helps "prime" your brain to connect new information.
7.  **Identify Key Vocabulary:** Look for bolded, italicized, or margin-listed terms and definitions. Look them up briefly if necessary, and keep them in mind as you read.

* **During Reading (Active Reading)**
8.  **Chunk Your Reading:** Instead of trying to read 50 pages at once, break the assignment into manageable, focused chunks (e.g., 10-15 pages or one major section).
9.  **Read with Your Questions in Mind:** Actively search for the answers to the questions you created in the "Before Reading" step.
10. **Annotate Margins (Instead of Just Highlighting):** Write short summaries, your own questions, keywords, or how the current section relates to a lecture point directly in the margin.
11. **Highlight Sparingly:** Limit highlighting to only the key term, a short phrase, or the absolute main idea‚Äîno more than $\text{10-20}\%$ of the text. Too much highlighting is as ineffective as none at all.
12. **Read Out Loud for Difficult Sections:** If you hit a complex paragraph or lose focus, reading the text aloud forces your brain to engage both visually and auditorily, boosting comprehension.
13. **Don't Get Stuck on Every Word:** If you don't immediately understand a term, make a quick note and keep reading. The surrounding context might clarify it, and you can always look it up later.
14. **Relate to Lecture Material:** Consciously make connections between the textbook and your professor's lectures. Note any areas where they overlap or where the book provides greater detail.

* **After Reading (Recite & Review)**
15. **Recite the Main Ideas (The "Teaching" Method):** After reading a chunk or section, close the book and recite the main points out loud in your own words, as if you are teaching the material to someone else.
16. **Take Notes from Memory:** Instead of taking notes *while* reading, read a section, close the book, and then summarize the key points in your notebook. Only open the book to verify facts you missed.
17. **Create a Concept Map or Outline:** Visually organize the material by creating a map of the main ideas and their supporting subtopics, which helps you see the relationship between concepts.
18. **Schedule a Review within 24 Hours:** A brief $\text{10-15}$ minute review of your notes or summaries the next day drastically improves retention and moves information into long-term memory.
19. **Regular Weekly Review:** Spend a short amount of time each week (e.g., $\text{10}$ minutes per course) reviewing past chapters and notes to prevent the need for cramming before exams.
20. **Self-Quiz:** Use your marginal questions, flashcards, or end-of-chapter questions to test your recall *without* looking at the book. This is the most effective way to prepare for a test.


## The parts of a book can generally be divided into three main sections
1. Front Matter (Before the main content)
* **Book Cover** (Front, Back, and Spine)
* **Half-Title Page** (or Bastard Title): Contains just the book's title.
* **Title Page:** Includes the full title, subtitle, author(s), and publisher.
* **Copyright Page:** Contains the copyright notice, publication date, ISBN, and cataloging information.
* **Dedication:** A page where the author dedicates the book to someone.
* **Table of Contents:** A list of chapters or sections with page numbers.
* **Foreword:** An introduction usually written by someone other than the author.
* **Preface:** An introductory passage written by the author, explaining how and why the book came to be.
* **Acknowledgements:** A note where the author thanks people who helped with the book.
* **Epigraph:** A relevant quotation, poem, or phrase placed before the main text or a chapter.
* **Introduction** (Non-fiction) or **Prologue** (Fiction): A beginning section that sets the stage for the main content.

2. Body (The main content)
* **Chapters/Parts:** The core narrative or informational text.

3. Back Matter (After the main content)
* **Epilogue** (Fiction) or **Conclusion** (Non-fiction): A closing section.
* **Afterword:** An author's note about the book's creation or a concluding reflection.
* **Appendix/Addendum:** Supplementary material (e.g., charts, documents) that is not essential to the main text.
* **Glossary:** An alphabetical list of specialized or difficult terms and their definitions.
* **Bibliography:** A list of sources and references used in the book.
* **Index:** An alphabetical list of keywords, names, and topics in the book with their page numbers.
* **Author Biography** (or "About the Author").

## book publishing 
* https://whitefalconpublishing.com/process.html
* You can track each book‚Äôs sales online (daily or even hourly if you wish to), receive monthly royalty statements and invoices, and control or change your book price
* If you price your book at $2.99 (a standard price for eBooks, used here as an example), you would earn either $2.09 or $1.05 in royalties per sold book as opposed to e. g. $0.09
* The difficult part is what comes after the book is written-- Self-editing, Professional-editing, Beta reading, Cover Designing, Publishing, and then Marketing., Review : the TBC Indie Author group, FWBA group or WriMo India
* Ghost writing : It's only when you are finalized, do you get to know the person behind it and meet them. After that, you shall be working quite closely with them, taking their notes, jotting down their mind maps, meeting them and talking to them over the phone quite often. Besides being a great learning tool,
* There are three primary elements of a blurb which are used as a formula for most of the books: 1. State the problem or conflict (hook) 2. Describe the situation (setting & conflict details) and 3. Promise of a surprise (cliffhanger).

**Steps publishing**
1. Step 1 - Have the manuscript ready.
1. Step 2 - Do a self-edit. (Do you want to make some changes to the Manuscript?) Be critical of your work, and savagely so. Check for spelling errors and grammar.
1. Step 3 - Go for professional editing- up to two or three rounds- followed by proofreading, preferably with the same editor. It‚Äôs easier, since they already know the story inside out and have talked and discussed with you on the pros and cons of the Manuscript. (Keep an open mind, listen to their feedback and work together to better it. You are the author of the Manuscript, so the final call is always yours to make regarding it.) 
1. Step 4 - Get a professional cover designer to design your cover. The cover is the face of your book, so please leave no stones unturned to achieve perfection.
1. Step 5 - Beta reading is the final step before publishing. It will give us a perspective of how a reader receives the book, of the story, and any editing errors missed. It is always nice to have more than two Beta readers as one will get more perspective, which in turn will help one to evaluate your book and see if you need work on any aspects of the book. Here we get a completely new set of eyes checking for any loopholes, anything missed out, any editing issues, anything jarring the flow of the book, etc. Yet again the final call is completely the author‚Äôs, but always keep an open mind to hear their opinions. 
1. Step 6 - Publishing.  If you are publishing via Amazon, you will find all the steps explained clearly in KDP- Kindle Direct Publishing.
