In case of pre-mature death of the bread-winner of the family, the family’s income will stop or reduce to a great extent.

SOURCES OF ‘POST RETIREMENT’ INCOME
- Savings and retirement proceeds from investments;
- Pension annuity from employer and/or insurer/mutual fund;
- Post retirement job to supplement income e.g. Teaching, part time consultancy etc
- Reverse Mortgage
- Regular income from investments in form of Dividend and Interest income

- Estate planning methods and tools
- Legal requirements

On the other hand, over long periods, equity has the potential to beat inflation,whereas debt may provide less than inflation returns after taxes.
That is why, a predominantly debt portfolio is recommended for near term goals, a balanced portfolio for medium term goals and a predominantly equity portfolio for long to very long-term goals.
Asset Allocation is also important because it is not possible to be invested in the best asset class at all times. Whereas the occasional rewards could be huge, the cost of a mistake could be very large.

**Salary components**
Salary = Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance + commission (if i’s a fixed % of sales turnover).
Completed year of service or part means: full time service of > 6 months is considered as 1 completed year of service; < 6 months is ignored.
Here, number of days in a month is considered as 26. Therefore, 15 days’ salary is arrived as = salary * 15/26
