**Lessons Learned from Scrubbing books**
- Pain Point :  accumulated lot of books and paper xerox copies 

_Action_ 
1. Donated 7 bags of paper (scrub time  ~ 4 months)

3. Retain 20% of paper , minimize paper clutter , 

_Benefits of  decluttering_
1. Cleared old files in BR2 
2. NOW accessing key files is super easy

_Why did this happen_
- Assumed we need this as reference for revision

1. If a person selects one subject and read all the books written on one subject, he can not clear a competitive exam. 
1. Rather who can remember physics/chemistry 60/60% and biology 80 per- cent will get better rank.
1. If you are not able to understand something just cram or leave it , you are not supposed to do research(rca fail : overenthusiasm)
