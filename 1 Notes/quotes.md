* LATCH == Location/AZ/Time/Category/Hierarchy , (1) Use LATCH principle (2) Organize for Findability (3) Easy Accessibility


## Declutter
"In the words of Francine Jay, “Remember: you are not what you own. Storing all those books doesn’t make you any smarter; it just makes your life more cluttered.”

“The more you have, the more you are occupied. The less you have, the more free you are.”—Mother Teresa

Thus, things lying around messily are reminders of tasks and goals that you haven’t achieved yet. But, these reminders are not effective reminders because your focus is scattered all over the place. When you declutter your space, you are, in effect, prioritizing your goals in your mind as well. This will help you focus much better on each goal, achieving it, and then moving on to the next.

**What are some important, but uncomfortable truths that many people learn when transitioning into adulthood?**
* Every person is responsible for their own happiness -- not their parents, not their boss, not their spouse, not their friends, not their government, not their deity.
* Practically all of the best opportunities (in business, in romance, etc) are only offered to people who already have more than they need.
* The idea that you will be happy after you make X amount of dollars is almost certainly an illusion., The idea that you will be happy after you meet [some amazing person] is almost certainly an illusion.
* When you don't possess leverage (go look up "BATNA"), people will take advantage of you, whether they mean to or not.
* Almost everybody is making it up as they go along. Also, many (most?) people are incompetent at their jobs.
* When talking about their background and accomplishments, almost everybody is continually overstating their abilities, impact, relevance, and contributions.
* Very few people will ever give you 100% candid, honest feedback.
* Certain people -- some of whom are in positions of enormous power -- just do not give a damn about other human beings.

**What are some useful computer related technical skills I can learn within a day?**
* Learn how to use Git and GitHub
* Learn how to use SVN
* Learn simple linux regular expressions
* Find a site with a few interview programming questions, and practice going through the full answer, with code, for some of them (a few a day should be good; do them in a language you don't know well if you already can ace most).
* Set up a crawler that can scrape some webpages and parse some basic data.
* Set up a bigger crawler that has to fill out a form or two.
* Program a basic linear algebra library (matrices, vectors, multiplication)
* Add SVD to this library , Add matrix inversion to this library
* Add least squares regression to this library
* Make your library work efficiently with sparse data.
* Learn how to use list comprehensions in python.
* Read the freaking manual for your favorite language. In the past I've wasted hours in Python because I didn't know that the Counter data structure existed, and kept getting the bugs from using Dicts as Counters. There are many examples like this.
* Get a stackoverflow account and learn to use the site. If you don't at least know that StackOverflow is an available resource, and you're an english-speaking programmer, you're doing it wrong.
* Implement a simple Machine learning algorithm on your own, with a whole pipeline. I.e. you read a simple input csv, split it into training and test set, run a simple algorithm with readily-tuneable or explorable hyperparameters, and a simple output of relevant statistics.
* Learn the how to make a simple line graph in Excel, and make sure you can do it right; i.e. properly labeled axes and tick marks, title and legends.
* Learn how to make a simple line graph in something other than Excel. Make sure you can do it right (same requirements).
* Get your eclipse installation fully pumped up: python dev tools, c dev tools, any other language you could ever write in, and make sure you can write a hello world successfully in each perspective. It'll save you time some future day.
* Learn the basic functionality of a NoSQL database; (you can learn a big chunk of mongoDB in a day)
* Learn the most basic functionality of SQL (you don't need to be a query guru,  but have a small clue about it).
* Learn a tool for in-depth parsing of HTML and XML
* Implement a list-of-lists graph data structure
* Implement random walk, PageRank, clustering coefficient finding (#triangles over possible triangles) and common neighbor number finding.
* Implement BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, topological sort and Minimum Spanning Tree (bonus for union-find version). Take a couple days if you have no algorithms background.
* Make a simple java applet that has at least some interaction with listeners and not just buttons and such.

* Pro-cons-Fixes ,
* Sorting/Chronologies/Timelines

**80 20 Rule**
* most popular 20 percent of products account for approximately 80 percent of sales;
* 20 percent of the largest customers also account for about 80 percent of sales;
* roughly 20 percent of sales account for 80 percent of profits. 
* 80 percent of wear and tear on your carpets will occur in only 20 percent of their area, 
* 20 percent of your clothes get worn 80 percent of the time.
* For the world wide web, 75/5 relationship: 5 percent of sites attracted 75 percent of visits; 
* For movies it is 80/1 (to the nearest round number): 1 percent of movies make 80 percent of the box office gross. 
* Shorthand notation : Sir Isaac Pitman invented shorthand after finding that just 700 words made up a staggering 70 percent of conversation. Including derivatives of these words, the Dictionary lists more than half a million words. fewer than 1 percent of words make up 80 percent of word usage. This pattern is very similar to that of the movies. 20% movies make 80% revenue

Maths
* Fibonacci Series : "1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 …3rd no = sum of first two no's , Growth rate : 1.618 , 60%
* Formula for projection , x = f/ (1-f) , a typical S curve , contant - grow - plateau
* x = the factor by which to measure growth
* f = the percentage of the relevant population with the plague
* 1 – f = the percentage of the population not infected with the plague.
* Zipf’s rank/size rule (the size of American cities) 
* obey Zipf’s rank/size rule, the population of a city in any country is inversely proportional to its ranking. 
* second largest city would have half the popln of the largest; and 3rd  would have one third the people of the top city, and so on."

**Economics**
* Law of diminishing returns , 1767 , This law says that after a point, increases in effort or investment result in diminishing returns; that is, the incremental value declines. To a hungry woman, a loaf of bread has high value. ,The tenth may have very little value.
* "Simon’s theory of clumps and lumps : Why do cities organize themselves like this?  But one idea that Herbert Simon came up with nearly a half-century ago, which may well be right, is that whatever size cities start out, they will then attract to themselves a similar proportion of any subsequent increase in population. Each existing city is a ‘clump’ of whatever size. When population increases, it does so in ‘lumps,’ not just through the excess of new births over deaths, but through lumps of new arrivals (by immigration in the case of the US; in many other countries by people drifting from the countryside). But each new lump will tend to attach itself to a clump in proportion to the existing size of the lump. Simon explains this by the availability of employment, and by the observed fact that most entrepreneurs (who provide the employment) stay near where they started."
