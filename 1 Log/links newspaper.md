**"The mentor’s playbook**
Speaking recently on The Gstaad Guy Podcast with Gustaf Lundberg Toresson, Schmidt shared that this practice was first encouraged by his mentor, the late Bill Campbell, the legendary “coach” to Silicon Valley’s top leaders. Each weekend, Schmidt carves out time to think, write, and plan the coming week — without distractions, phones, or notifications."

**Steve Jobs’ ‘strong message’ to engineers that remained Apple's guiding doctrine**
"Apple founder Steve Jobs once told the company engineers that the people who make real breakthroughs are not just thinkers, but also doers. In the early 1990s, Jobs addressed Apple engineers where he said “The doers are the major thinkers”, further citing Leonrado Da Vinci. He added “Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side thinking five years out what he would paint? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints.”"

**Jensen Huang**
"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently opened up about his personal use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, saying he switches between platforms depending on the tasks. Speaking at an interview in London recently, Huang said that among Elon Musk’s Grok, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google’s Gemini, his favorite “depends on what I’m doing”. Explaining further, the Nvidia CEO said “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT”."


**N Narayana Murthy**
I observed how in a western country even the socialists understood that wealth has first to be created before it can be distributed; 
that there could only be a few leaders to create wealth. And that it’s the job of the government to create an environment

After admitting he uses ChatGPT, Narayana Murthy says management and technology graduates are same for him - India Today 

Different approaches, shared goals in problem-solving
The 78-year-old industry pioneer outlined the distinct yet interconnected roles each group plays in organisational success. "One asks 'what,' while the other focuses on 'how.' Technical people look at 'how,' and the management graduates look at 'what,'" he clarified, highlighting how both perspectives are essential for comprehensive problem-solving.

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary


**Elon Musk's 'wake-up call' for America echoes what brother Kimbal Musk said on Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' - The Times of India**

Solar power in China will exceed ALL sources of electricity combined in the USA in 3 to 4 years. Wake up call,” Musk said in a post which showed data from Ember, a global energy think tank. Ember’s data chart suggests China's solar output hit 100 TWh in May 2025 and is doubling every two years, outpacing the US's 400

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

Why studying at MIT gives you an unbeatable edge in the job market - Times of India

"Whether it’s Google, Goldman Sachs, McKinsey, NASA, or pioneering start-ups, MIT alumni consistently land roles at the forefront of their fields.

**An economy allergic to failure': Tech CEO says UPSC is where India buries its ambition - BusinessToday**

"With its vast syllabus, unpredictable questions, and multi-stage eliminations, UPSC demands immense intellectual energy. But Singhal’s point is clear: that same energy could help power India’s next wave of innovation—if it weren’t stuck in exam halls.

“India doesn’t lack talent,” he concluded. “Its efforts are misplaced.”"

**Oct 21 AWS outage**
"The global cloud market is dominated by three companies. AWS holds the largest share (roughly 30 per cent), followed by Microsoft Azure (20 per cent) and Google Cloud Platform (13 per cent).

All three service providers have had recent outages, significantly impacting digital service platforms. In 2024, an issue with third-party software severely impacted Microsoft Azure, causing extensive operational failures for businesses globally. Google Cloud Platform also experienced a major outage this year due to an internal misconfiguration"
