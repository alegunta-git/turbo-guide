## PRJ Unstructured Reading
**Pain Points**
* boil ocean wrt reading , ONLY Reading familiar topics(SH) , same books again and again
* Did not maintain revision notes/Cheat Sheet ,Not applying concepts
* Not exploring LIG Skills , cooking , ifb dish washing 

**Lessons Learned from Scrubbing books**
* PP : accumulated lot of books and paper xerox copies 
* Difference between knowledge vs understanding , Study for information 
* Too Much information leading to scatter brained functionality
* DONT STORE too many  BOOKS at Home , Home != LIBRARY
* why : (a) store books as ref for later revision (!happen) (b)print xerox docs and we don’t review docs (c) IDNK syndrome
* corrective action : scrub books 4 months , donated 7 bags , scan docs , pdf upload gd , min paper clutter
* Benefits of  decluttering : Cleared old files in BR2 , NOW accessing key files is super easy

**How to fix**
* Stop goals books per day/week , discontinue tracking reading list , Quit reading More Books 
* Identify key themes per quarter , read limited set of books , Apply concepts / revise key items
* List top 20 categories we are interested in , Map reading list to reading roadmap to CRF areas
* Only Read 2*3 books for each category , 2 many book spoil the broth 
* Backlog : MUST/Reference/Information 
* On pc , retain minimal set , NOT 10+GB data , Organize reading stuff on g Drive 
* Reduce news paper inventory * if not read for 2 weeks , give it up
