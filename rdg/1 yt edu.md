## Study Skills
**Golden Book - notebook imp points - revision on weekends**
* Tables till 20, Factorials till 10, Square roots till 10,
* Squares from 1 to 30, Cubes from 1 to 20,
* Fractions and their Decimal Notations,
* Powers of 2, 3 and 5 till 7th power,

**Studying an NCERT textbook effectively is all about active engagement:**
1. *Skim the chapter first* – glance at headings, bold terms, and the summary to get the big picture.
2. *Read with a purpose* – underline key points, write short margin notes, and try to explain each concept in your own words.
3. *Solve the exercises* – do every “Check Your Understanding” and end‑of‑chapter question; it reinforces recall and highlights gaps.
4. *Make quick flashcards* – turn definitions, dates, or formulas into bite‑size cards for quick review.
5. *Teach it back* – explain the topic to a friend or record yourself; teaching reveals what you still need to clarify.

## 20 tips for reading college textbook, 
**Before Reading (Survey & Question)**
organized by the steps of the reading process (often referred to as a variation of the SQ3R or P2R method)
1.  **Read the Chapter Summary First:** Get the "big picture" and the main conclusions the author wants you to reach *before* diving into the details.
2.  **Turn Headings into Questions:** Convert chapter titles and section headings into *Who, What, Why, or How* questions. This gives you a clear purpose for reading.
    * *Example:* "The Cell Membrane Structure" becomes "What is the structure of the cell membrane?"
3.  **Preview All Visuals:** Examine charts, graphs, diagrams, and photos. Read the captions. These visuals often represent key concepts or processes that will be on an exam.
4.  **Skim the Introduction and Conclusion:** This provides context and highlights the most essential themes.
5.  **Review End-of-Chapter Questions:** Know what information you'll be expected to recall or apply. Read the chapter specifically looking for the answers to those questions.
6.  **Assess Your Prior Knowledge:** Briefly recall and jot down what you already know about the topic. This helps "prime" your brain to connect new information.
7.  **Identify Key Vocabulary:** Look for bolded, italicized, or margin-listed terms and definitions. Look them up briefly if necessary, and keep them in mind as you read.

* **During Reading (Active Reading)**
8.  **Chunk Your Reading:** Instead of trying to read 50 pages at once, break the assignment into manageable, focused chunks (e.g., 10-15 pages or one major section).
9.  **Read with Your Questions in Mind:** Actively search for the answers to the questions you created in the "Before Reading" step.
10. **Annotate Margins (Instead of Just Highlighting):** Write short summaries, your own questions, keywords, or how the current section relates to a lecture point directly in the margin.
11. **Highlight Sparingly:** Limit highlighting to only the key term, a short phrase, or the absolute main idea—no more than $\text{10-20}\%$ of the text. Too much highlighting is as ineffective as none at all.
12. **Read Out Loud for Difficult Sections:** If you hit a complex paragraph or lose focus, reading the text aloud forces your brain to engage both visually and auditorily, boosting comprehension.
13. **Don't Get Stuck on Every Word:** If you don't immediately understand a term, make a quick note and keep reading. The surrounding context might clarify it, and you can always look it up later.
14. **Relate to Lecture Material:** Consciously make connections between the textbook and your professor's lectures. Note any areas where they overlap or where the book provides greater detail.

* **After Reading (Recite & Review)**
15. **Recite the Main Ideas (The "Teaching" Method):** After reading a chunk or section, close the book and recite the main points out loud in your own words, as if you are teaching the material to someone else.
16. **Take Notes from Memory:** Instead of taking notes *while* reading, read a section, close the book, and then summarize the key points in your notebook. Only open the book to verify facts you missed.
17. **Create a Concept Map or Outline:** Visually organize the material by creating a map of the main ideas and their supporting subtopics, which helps you see the relationship between concepts.
18. **Schedule a Review within 24 Hours:** A brief $\text{10-15}$ minute review of your notes or summaries the next day drastically improves retention and moves information into long-term memory.
19. **Regular Weekly Review:** Spend a short amount of time each week (e.g., $\text{10}$ minutes per course) reviewing past chapters and notes to prevent the need for cramming before exams.
20. **Self-Quiz:** Use your marginal questions, flashcards, or end-of-chapter questions to test your recall *without* looking at the book. This is the most effective way to prepare for a test.
