**How to publish Book**

* You can track each book’s sales online (daily or even hourly if you wish to), receive monthly royalty statements and invoices, and control or change your book price
* If you price your book at $2.99 (a standard price for eBooks, used here as an example), you would earn either $2.09 or $1.05 in royalties per sold book as opposed to e. g. $0.09
* The difficult part is what comes after the book is written-- Self-editing, Professional-editing, Beta reading, Cover Designing, Publishing, and then Marketing., Review : the TBC Indie Author group, FWBA group or WriMo India
* Ghost writing : It's only when you are finalized, do you get to know the person behind it and meet them. After that, you shall be working quite closely with them, taking their notes, jotting down their mind maps, meeting them and talking to them over the phone quite often. Besides being a great learning tool,
* There are three primary elements of a blurb which are used as a formula for most of the books: 1. State the problem or conflict (hook) 2. Describe the situation (setting & conflict details) and 3. Promise of a surprise (cliffhanger).

**Steps publishing**
1. Step 1 - Have the manuscript ready.
1. Step 2 - Do a self-edit. (Do you want to make some changes to the Manuscript?) Be critical of your work, and savagely so. Check for spelling errors and grammar.
1. Step 3 - Go for professional editing- up to two or three rounds- followed by proofreading, preferably with the same editor. It’s easier, since they already know the story inside out and have talked and discussed with you on the pros and cons of the Manuscript. (Keep an open mind, listen to their feedback and work together to better it. You are the author of the Manuscript, so the final call is always yours to make regarding it.) 
1. Step 4 - Get a professional cover designer to design your cover. The cover is the face of your book, so please leave no stones unturned to achieve perfection.
1. Step 5 - Beta reading is the final step before publishing. It will give us a perspective of how a reader receives the book, of the story, and any editing errors missed. It is always nice to have more than two Beta readers as one will get more perspective, which in turn will help one to evaluate your book and see if you need work on any aspects of the book. Here we get a completely new set of eyes checking for any loopholes, anything missed out, any editing issues, anything jarring the flow of the book, etc. Yet again the final call is completely the author’s, but always keep an open mind to hear their opinions. 
1. Step 6 - Publishing.  If you are publishing via Amazon, you will find all the steps explained clearly in KDP- Kindle Direct Publishing.
