* Real est : Location , Location , Location , Renovation , Renovation (aka maintenance)

* Anti-Patterns : Procrastrination , too many choices , Analysis Paralysis
* 7/5/3 rule upsc , ans 7 min/Q , Write 5 points in ans , keyword(bullet pts) , Elaborate each point in 3 dimensions 

**Maths**
* Fibonacci Series : "1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 …3rd no = sum of first two no's , Growth rate : 1.618 , 60%
* Formula for projection , x = f/ (1-f) , a typical S curve , contant - grow - plateau
* x = the factor by which to measure growth
* f = the percentage of the relevant population with the plague
* 1 – f = the percentage of the population not infected with the plague.
* Zipf’s rank/size rule (the size of American cities) 
* obey Zipf’s rank/size rule, the population of a city in any country is inversely proportional to its ranking. 
* second largest city would have half the popln of the largest; and 3rd  would have one third the people of the top city, and so on."

**80 20 Rule**
* most popular 20 percent of products account for approximately 80 percent of sales;
* 20 percent of the largest customers also account for about 80 percent of sales;
* roughly 20 percent of sales account for 80 percent of profits. 
* 80 percent of wear and tear on your carpets will occur in only 20 percent of their area, 
* 20 percent of your clothes get worn 80 percent of the time.
* For the world wide web, 75/5 relationship: 5 percent of sites attracted 75 percent of visits; 
* For movies it is 80/1 (to the nearest round number): 1 percent of movies make 80 percent of the box office gross. 
* Shorthand notation : Sir Isaac Pitman invented shorthand after finding that just 700 words made up a staggering 70 percent of conversation. Including derivatives of these words, the Dictionary lists more than half a million words. fewer than 1 percent of words make up 80 percent of word usage. This pattern is very similar to that of the movies. 20% movies make 80% revenue


**Economics**
* Law of diminishing returns , 1767 , This law says that after a point, increases in effort or investment result in diminishing returns; that is, the incremental value declines. To a hungry woman, a loaf of bread has high value. ,The tenth may have very little value.
* "Simon’s theory of clumps and lumps : Why do cities organize themselves like this?  But one idea that Herbert Simon came up with nearly a half-century ago, which may well be right, is that whatever size cities start out, they will then attract to themselves a similar proportion of any subsequent increase in population. Each existing city is a ‘clump’ of whatever size. When population increases, it does so in ‘lumps,’ not just through the excess of new births over deaths, but through lumps of new arrivals (by immigration in the case of the US; in many other countries by people drifting from the countryside). But each new lump will tend to attach itself to a clump in proportion to the existing size of the lump. Simon explains this by the availability of employment, and by the observed fact that most entrepreneurs (who provide the employment) stay near where they started."
