Insurance Planning
In case of pre-mature death of the bread-winner of the family, the family’s income will stop or reduce to a great extent.
In such a case, the family will have to depend on some money that can generate income to at least cover the expenses, commitments and liabilities for the rest of their life. How much would the amount required be?
- How much of health insurance is required to protect a client and his/ her dependents to meet with a medical emergency?
- Which type of accident policy and critical illness policy will suit the client?
- Is there a need to have insurance of household goods?
- Determine whether the client has adequate insurance or not. Also determine if the client is over-insured.
- What are the risks to the client’s (or family’s) income earning capacity?
- What are the risks of loss with respect to the assets owned by the family?

Tax Planning
- Tax planning objectives , Tax planning strategies
- Income tax (individuals and business)
- Taxation of investments (income and capital gains)
- Taxation of assets and the tax nature of liabilities
- Taxation on gifting (e.g., donations to family)
- Taxation of an estate

Other tax
- International tax issues
- Tax calculations
- Tax-efficient structures and their taxation
- Tax administration (compliance and tax returns)

Is the client making optimum use of all available tax benefits
- How to lower the tax liability? How to increase tax-adjusted returns on investments?
- What are the changes in tax laws that may affect cash flows, invest ments and savings?
- What is the effect of capital gains on investments?
- How to calculate tax liability for the previous year?
- How to avoid just the year-end tax saving and do strategic tax planning?

Retirement Planning
- Retirement objectives
- Retirement needs analysis and projections
- Potential sources of retirement income: ( aState-sponsored bEmployer-sponsored cPersonal)
- Retirement savings products
- Other sources of retirement income
- Retirement income projections

What is the retirement corpus required to lead the same lifestyle after retirement
- How will inflation affect the sustainability of Retirement corpus in post retirement years?
- What are the various options and what is their role in investments for retirement
- Is there scope for early retirement, or retirement is postponed due to inadequate corpus?
- What additional investments should be made to build retirement corpus?

SOURCES OF ‘POST RETIREMENT’ INCOME
- Savings and retirement proceeds from investments;
- Pension annuity from employer and/or insurer/mutual fund;
- Post retirement job to supplement income e.g. Teaching, part time consultancy etc
- Reverse Mortgage
- Regular income from investments in form of Dividend and Interest income

Estate Planning
- Estate planning objectives
- Property ownership and its implications for succession planning
- Estate planning methods and tools
- Legal requirements
- Property transfer at death
- Projected liquidity at death
- Estate planning legal documents

On the other hand, over long periods, equity has the potential to beat inflation,whereas debt may provide less than inflation returns after taxes.
That is why, a predominantly debt portfolio is recommended for near term goals, a balanced portfolio for medium term goals and a predominantly equity portfolio for long to very long-term goals.
Asset Allocation is also important because it is not possible to be invested in the best asset class at all times. Whereas the occasional rewards could be huge, the cost of a mistake could be very large.

Salary = Basic Salary + Dearness Allowance + commission (if i’s a fixed % of sales turnover).
• Completed year of service or part means: full time service of > 6 months is considered as 1 completed year of service; < 6 months is ignored.
• Here, number of days in a month is considered as 26. Therefore, 15 days’ salary is arrived as = salary * 15/26

Basics - IEAL
Income , Expense , Asset , Liability 
Income - Expense = Cash Flow
Assets - Debts = Net Worth
 
**Net Worth**
NW = Age * Pretax Income / 10 
 
Tax 
Tax Planning = ELSS + NPS + PPF
Post Office Investment = FD + SCSS

How to calculate average/compound annual growth rate in Excel?
Int Rate and Tax 
Int Rate - (Int Rate * Tax rate)
= 10 - 10 * 30% = 10 - 10 * 0.3 = 7
 
# How much we need 
= a* (1+r) ^ n   |  = 1200000 * ( 1+7% ) ^ 15 = 33 10 838 
7 % inflation , 15 yr child education , Current Val 12l
 
# How much to invest 
= PMT(rate , nper , PV , FV) 
= PMT( 12%/12 , 15.12 , 0 , 33 10 838)
 
# How much to invest in stock 
100 -  Current Age of = % in Equity
@30 - 70% , @60- 40%
 
 
 
# Rule of Thumb
2x 72 / 9 % = 8 years ( 72 / r% ) 
3x 114/ 3 % = 38 years ( 114 / r% ) 
4x  144  / 12 % = 12 years ( 144 / r% )

1. Compound Interest 
Formula: A = P * (1+r/t) ^ (nt)
Total amount you will receive after 10 years will be  = 1,00,000(1+0.1) ^10 = 2,59,374.25
 
2. Post Tax Return
Formula = Interest rate - (Interest rate*tax rate)  = 10-(10*30%) = 7
 
3. Inflation
Formula: Future amount = Present amount * (1+inflation rate) ^number of years
= 10,000* (1+5%) ^10 = 16,289
 
4. Purchasing Power
Formula: Future Value = Present value/(1+inflation rate)^number of years
   =10,000/ (1+5%) ^10 = 6,139
 
5. Effective Annual Rate 
Formula: Effective Annual Rate = (1+(r/n))^n)-1*100
If an investment is made at 9 per cent annual rate and compounding is done quarterly, the effective annual rate will be (1+(0.09/4)^4) -1*100  = 9.3 per cent
 
6. Rule of 72 
If you are assuming a 12 per cent return on your investment, the number of years in which the money will double is = 72/Interest rate= 72/12 = 6 years 
 
7. Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)
indicate the return on an investment over a period. It is also the best tool to compare returns of two different asset classes - for instance gold/equity or equity/real estate. 
Formula:  CAGR=((FV/PV)^(1/n)) - 1
Suppose that an investment of Rs 1,000 grows to Rs 5,000 in 10 years.
CAGR is ((5,000/1,000)^(1/10)) - 1 , This comes to 17.4 per cent, 
((20,000/10,000) ^(1/2)) - 1, the CAGR comes to 41.42 per cent.
 
8. Loan EMI 
Formula: EMI= (A*R)*(1+R) ^N/ ((1+R) ^N)-1)
Where A = Loan amount ,  R = Interest rate N= Duration
Suppose you have taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh at 11 per cent annual interest for 15 years. 1
1 per cent per annum translates into 11/1200 = 0.00916 per month
Tenure = 15*12 = 180 months
EMI = (1000000 x 0.00916) x
((1+.00916) ^180) / ([(1+.00916) ^180] - 1)  = = Rs 11,361 
 
9. Future Value of SIP 
Formula: S = R((1+i)^n-1/i) (1+i)
S = Future value of investment ,   R = Regular monthly investment  , i = Interest rate assumed /12
n = Duration (number of months or number of years *12) investing Rs 1,000 each month for the next 10 years and expect a return of 15 per cent. 
 
Monthly over next 10 years = 12*10 = 120 months
Interest: 15% per annum - 15/12 = 1.25% = 0.0125
S = 1,000 * [{(1+ 0.0125) ^120 - 1}/0.0125] *  (1+ 0.0125)  = The outcome is Rs 2,78,657, which is the future value of the SIP.
 
10. Liquidity Ratio
Formula:Liquidity Ratio = Total liquid assets\Total current debt
The value of this ratio should ideally be above one. 
 
Some points to note
1. NPV is an absolute number
2. IRR is expressed in % terms
3. NPV calculates additional wealth
4. IRR reflects investment performance as well as cash flows
5. Use of IRR facilitates comparison
6. NPV and IRR both are discounted cash flow models
7. Since NPV is a direct measure of increase in wealth, NPV is preferred over IRR in case of conflict in mutually exclusive investments (where we have to select only one investment). In case of a scenario like: A’s NPV is high & B’s IRR is high, always go with the higher NPV option.
Summary of formulae used
PV formula is PV= FV/ (1+r) ^n; In Excel =PV (rate, nper, pmt, fv, type)
PV of ordinary annuity (PVA) = PMT * 1-(1+i)^-n/i
In Excel = PMT (RATE, NPER, PV, FV, Type)
Payback period = Initial investment amount/value ÷ Cash flow per year
The formula of Compounding is FV = PV (1+r/100) ^n
HPR=(EV-BV/BV) *100
Inflation adjusted returns = [(1+ r) / (1+P)}-1]*100, where r is nominal
return and P is inflation rate
Tax Adjusted returns TR = NR * (1-tax rate), where TR: tax adjusted
return and NR: nominal return
IRR= NPV= FV/ (1+r) ^3
Total return = (EV - BV)/ BV *100
Sharpe Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfoli
volatility (v)
Treynor Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfoli
beta (b)
Jensen Ratio (S) = R (actual portfolio return) – SML (expected return)
SML= Rf+ ß (Rm- Rf), where Rf is risk free return, ß is portfolio beta
and Rm is market return.
