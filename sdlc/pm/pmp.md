## As per GSR 

* **Jobs**  
  * Most people have ‘Tiffin Carrier’ and NOT ‘Career’ on the day job  
  * 60% people by birth are followers , 20% are resistors and 20% are Leader  
  * 90% \- No Goals , 7% have goals but don’t write them , 3% \- written goals  
  * Fear of rejection and failure (Risk Averse and Conformance)  
  * Beyond 10 yrs , its not your CV it is your ability to ‘perform’ on the job as a Manager that will help you to gain Promotion and move ahead  
  * Every 8-10 yrs , organization would like to shed / churn the workforce , so if you have been an engineer , transition to a PM/GM Role   
    * Your first 3 yeaars in the initial 10 yrs will be given to you , whether you look good bad or ugly and whether you are lousy or ambitious   
    * Next shift from TL to PM involves a transition period of 2 yrs , where you need to shed your technical skin and become comfy with ‘Project Management’ skill  
    * As a GM you need to be broad based strategic and highly efficient wrt Operations and Execution  
    * Nimbu nichodke kaam nikal wana hai sir engg se ( aggressive and authority)  
  * Life – 90% maintenance , 5% \- Happiness , 5% \- sadness  
* **PMI Exam Preparation**  
  * For Preparing for PMI Exam , if you can find time get up early at 5am   
    * Study from 5 am to 7 am   
    * Then do your day job 7 am to 7 pm   
* **Study material**	  
  * First 2 weeks : Go through the Terms – gsr book  
  * Next 2 weeks , understand Flow for Process areas  
  * Next 4 weeks Focus on PMBOK and complete questions  
* **Timeline**  
  * If you can spend 2 hrs /day and study consistently , we should be able to prepare well for exam in 4-6 weeks ( 60-80 hrs max)   
  * Execution \= Strategy , Operations and People

Big Qs  fragment – reframe Q – select option

Probable causes of delay : Unclear Objectives , disorganized , inability to say NO , Interruptions , periods of inactivity

Stress and fatigue : all work and no play 

DNA : Disengage , negotiate and agree (Don’t force things on people) 

When \+ What \= Scchedule completion 

RBS – available and not available ( then go to mgmt.)pictorial format no email and writing 

Effort time ,idle time 

8 hrs – 1 hr lunch , 6 hr work , other meeting 

PERT , optimistic – risks reduced , no constraints , Most likely – dependencies on past experience Pessimistic – resource availability , resource productivity , all types of risks ( worst case scenario)

Less range , less risk 

Be real cool with statisitcs and scheduling and MS project move towards the median 

What best we can do , what worst can happen

Skill of discovering constraints 

**Top Manager and Sr Manager paid mode to handle constraints and Risks** 

Estimations affected by Perceptions and constraints 

40% of employees work on non critical activities in every company

Use network diagrams to convince Top Mgmt(Fish Market)

Lack of resource availability (overstaying)

Make 2 schedule ( unlevelled and levelled ) – negotiate with mgmt. 

Fast tracking ( work more , cut requests )  more qs on fast tracking and crashing 

Create tolerances before creating a plan (max and min)

**Every Seller organization does bottom up estiamtion**

Estimates give range 

| Profit Margin |
| :---- |
| Fixed Costs and Overhead Costs |
| Risk Buffer |
| Direct Costs , variables Costs  |

Probability is the language of estimations

Total uncertainty – general uncertainty – specific uncertainty – total certainty 

Risk is uncertainity 

How to manage risks through people by taking decisions and actions 

Risk taking is a must for survival (learn how to systematically manage uncertainities)

Take corrective action – investigate – root cause analysis – fishbone diagram 

Skill to ask Why Questions 

Karma , ostrich head egg syndrome 

**Many Project suffer due to lack of follow up** 

Low risk – TL can don High Risk Quantitative analysis

How to split time

| 10 % Meeting | 60% risk management | 30% Motivation and Team building |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

You cant drive a car by looking back 

All (feasibility 65% , high level plan 75% , micro plan 80%)

**Fallback plan ( very High Risk ) , Workaround( Fire fighting ) , Corrective action**

Common to JW and GSR – Time management

Now I understand JW used to ask for 90% confidence level 

U can survive as TL w/o using Fishbone diagram ,wef Mgr learn it 

**PMI Qs Don’t ask for Corrective actions Focus is on Preventing Problems**

Key soft skills for Mgmt career – GM skills , deal with people , deal with groups

C – Effort 

Manage projects better by EVM and not with supervision 

Project completion , Budget spent , Time 

**PM Should focus on Completion**

**IF SV \= 0 , On target as on date , SV \> 0 ahead of schedule , SV \< 0 behind schedule**

CPI 0.85 to 1.15 (Control Costs0

CPI \<0.80 Control things 

CPI \< 0.75 working hard – plan defective 

CPI \> 1.2 fast track

**Weekly Review meeting | dashboard**

1. Discuss future tense  
2. Identify probable causes(take action)  
3. Delegate to junior ( take actions )   
4. Pls plan meetings

Where we have been , where are we now , where will be going

**Take a decision kya karna go to manager – evaluate options – fast tracking and crashing** 

Don’t go to mgmt. team w/o doing homework

2. Mgmr ( cause of bugs , why , RCA)

**Requiring** 

1. Trend graphs   
2. Why bugs   
3. Where they occur   
4. Priorities – how to solve

* Last 1/3 pressure should not be on Team ( poor quality issues)  
* Credibility is important from strategic point of view and in order to be credible project team has to deliver

| :---- | :---- | :---- |

**Scope Verification**

* Verify work against specification / standards   
* Approved by Quality Team  
* Happens when you produce deliverables  
* Complies with *documented acceptance criteria ( from internal / external customers and stakeholders)*  
* 3-5 qs on scope verification

  * Exit Criteria  
* Scope creep often result in cost overrun   
* Check variances against WBS / activities list   
* *Schedule Controls*  
  * Remove constraints

  * All cost and time estimates based on Mean not Mode and Median  
* More questions on Preventive action   
  * Prevention : ensure earlier detection   
  * Inspection : prevent occurrence of errors before reaching customers  
  * Things from business point of view  
    * Trend graphs ( is process improving)

    * Process 6 sigma where problems are occurring   
    * Frequency of occurrence   
    * **Priorities: where we should act first**  
    * Scatter diagram : correlation issues  
* Close out  
  * Acceptance critieria  
  * Exit critieria  
  * Gain formal acceptance   
  * Check we have met customers expectations and objectives  
  * For Seller Organisation – Having a WBS really helpful in assessing for work done and claiming the amount   
    * US CO – lack of WBS resulted in 8 yrs of effort and 15% amount payment due to amicable settlement  
* Misc  
  * PM Don’t pass the buck   
  * Maintain integrity , tell some technical sry we cannot do , get back to you  
* Why Do we fail

  * We lie   
  * We cheat  
  * We don’t believe in planning   
  * We are optimistic by default   
  * We steal   
  * We try to make it up

**Clients want the Best and Least Expensive**

On Companies with less matured PM Process – Slippages ( Cost 20% , Time 40%)

Project Management is a Discipline which requires ‘DISCIPLINE’

PMP exam – Tests for ( Team , Risk , Stakeholders)

5 hrs \* 20 days / m \* 12 m / yr \= 1200 hrs / yr ( 4-4.5 yrs) 

Imp Soft Skill ( Planning – Call a team meeting , Expedite phase : Don’t call a Team meeting) 

I think / I might decision – ‘Risk Management’ Document it as someone wants to change – need to verify and evaluate check
