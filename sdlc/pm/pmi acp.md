## PMI ACP Exam Notes
* The Agile Manifesto was developed with Software Developers in the mind  
* If your Manager asks to start a project without a valid contract from the Customer – create an impact analysis of starting the project without the contract  
* Agile project deliver reliable results by enaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership  
* Process of defining abd documenting stakeholders needs to meet project objecitves is called collect requirements  
* Developing detailed description of project and product is called define scope   
* Middle of the project and the customer Is not happy with deliverables given last week – talk to the customer , u need to understand why the customer is not happy  
* Agile way of Product development – to produce working product early and incrementally   
* Change control process – PMs top priority first try preventing unncessary changes before trying other options   
* Agile projects boost perfirmance through group accountability for results and shared responsibioity for team effectiviness  
* Customer provides the SOW as part of bidding process  
* SOW \= Business need , Prouct scope description and Strategic plan ( not cost estimation)  
* Corrective action – documented direction for executing the project work to bring expected future performance of the project work in line with the PM plan  
* Preventive action – documented directions to perform an activity that can reduce the probability of negative consequences associated with project risks  
* Defect repair – recommendtion o repair the defect  
* Work performance information – deliveravle status , schedule progress , cost incurred   
* Project execution most of the budget is spent   
* Iteration retrospective is for the last completed iteration – so something new in each iteration  
* Middle of project and resource are not available –so make an impact plan on the project due to non availability of resources( wrong ans stopthe work  inform customer etc)  
* Integration is the key responsibility of PM   
*   
* Agile teams – 8 to 12 , cross functional and self organizing  
* Project communication management ( PM 90%) , distribute information  \- info available to stakeholders , stakeholder management strategy  \- increase the suport and minimize tge negative impacts of stakeholders ., WSR – formal written communication  informative workspace – give visibility ot the team   
* Communication management plan – doc depicting who needs twhat information , when how and by whom 9right format , right time  with the right impact  
* Providing the needed information is the efficient communication  
* Make team meetings effective – set ground rules , create and stick to the agenda , document and publish the minutes if the meeting  
* 11 stakholders , 55 comms channels   
* Distance , noise , language – communication barrier   
* Push communication ( letterss reports and press release ) push the informaion to receiver , pull out the information from sender  
* Tracking the project result over time to see performance is improving or deteriorating – trend reports   
* Information radiator provide quick and easy update to all stakeholders  
* Forecasting methods – judgement , time series , econometric , variance analysis comapre the current state with the baseline or expected state ( not forecast)  
* Agile free flow of face to face info \+ lean but sufficient  documentation   
* Comm barriers lead to conflict  
* Stand up meeting short and structures  
* Effectibe team space – easy communica tion flow   
* Status / project reports helps to identify quickly where the project stands   
* Stakeholder management strategy – key people impact prj , level of participation . stakeholder groups ,comms plan – urgency and need of information   
* End user value – incremental delivery , prioritization , quick clarifications , eliminate wastes  
* Team value – empower , trust , defining the work , self organized , future leaders , respect , training , systems thinking ,   
* Life cycle cost – dev cost \+ maintenance cost \+ operations cost \+ disposal cost   
* Economic models – payback period  pv , fv , npv , irr , roi ,   
* Roi \= gain – cost / cost   
* Roi \= velocity \* margin   
* Adaptive planning (rolling wave planning , progressive elaboration )Vs predictive planning : business need change , feature larger than expected , customer refinement of requirements , technical constraints , 3rd part delay , team throughput lower than expected   
* User stories ; as a role I want to do feature so that I can do reason / benefit ( Business , Technical and Bug type US)  
* Scrum – 6 formal time boxed events – release planning , sprint planning , sprint , sprint review , sprint retro , daily scrum  
* 5 business objectives agile project – continuous innovation , product adaptability , improved time to market , people and process capability , reliable results   
* Release backlog features measured in story points , iteration backlog tasks  in hours   
* Agile team productivity metrics – cycle time  release burn down , customer support  
* Fail fast – agile philosophy  
* Project data sheet – 1p – key project information , business objectives , product capabilities   
* Stpries are cutomer centric , describing the results in business   
* Technical debt decreases , velocity will increase again   
* Progress report – vision statement , weekly demo , release and iteration plans , burn up chart , roadmap , status email   
* Management report – productivity, throughput(number of features developed in a given timeframe) , defects , time usage  
* vision statement – what project should accomplish , why it is valuable , project success criteria  
* mmf – competitive differentiation , revenue generation , cost savings   
* get data , validate data , write data to db   
* process customer data , process shipping data , process billing information  
* scope boxed define the featurses dte uncertain and time boxed plans defines release date in advance, specific features uncertain   
* 10% iteration on technical debt  
* Stpries – customer value written in customer terminology , describe an end result customer values not implementation details , clear completion criteria , objective test for completion   
* Agile methods principles – customer involvement  incremental delivery , people not process  system is deigned for change  
* Empirical process – visibility , inspection anfd adaptation   
* User Stories  
  * Customer focused , domain experts write US , use the simplest tool (index card) , write in simple language ,   
  * include unique story number , include the priority number , include the estimated size   
  * INVEST – Independent , Negotiable , Valuable , Estimable , Sized properly , Testable   
* Epics , Features and User Stories   
  * Epics ( collections of features , 1-3 months in duration) , Features ( 2-4 weeks ) , US ( smallest increment of value , executed less than a week)  
* Product Backlog – Release Backlog – Iteration Backlog  
  * Product Visioning   
  * Product Roadmap  
  * Released Planning   
  * Iterative Cycle Planning  
  * Daily Planning  
* Contracts  
  * Price/Fixed Scope / Fixed Time contract   
    * Not suitable for agile , customer work closely with vendor scroping , review contract every iteration , signoff at sprint , reusable components and templates to speed up work , break the contract at any time , convert to TM , prioritize the requiremns (Scope)   
  * Time and Materials contract  
    * Suitable for agile , client pays for the hours – team members customer may seek a trial period of 6 months , customer trust the skill level / experience of vendor , review every 6 months , hike by 5% evert year   
* Charts  
  * Sprint Burn down and Burn Up  
  * Release burn down and burn up   
  * Cumulative flow diagram   
  * Lead time \= wIP (units) / Average completion rate ( units per time period)  
  * Work in Progress \= Lead time \* Average completion rate (units)  
  * Average Completion rate \= WIP / Lead time   
  * EV of the release \= Sum of EV of iterations   
  * Kanban Board (Tasks / Feature / Stories)  
* Retrospectives   
  * Process improvements , team in self improving mode   
  * Collaborative process all memvers of team  
  * www and wci   
  * actions and lessons are prioritized based on teams direction   
  * works out solutions for most prominent problems   
    * Process  
      * Set the stage ( working arrangement , ground rules)  
      * Gather data ( relevant data , sahred picture)  
      * Generate insights ( time to ask why , time to ask how )   
      * Decide what to do ( action plan , impediments)  
      * Close retro ( Say thanks and Appreciate)  
      * Start doing , stop doing , continue doing  
* Agile planning adaptive and iterative  
* Role of PO provide input on the business value for effective prioritization of requirements  
* Whole team to be considered for repriortiization  consider both business value and technical feasibility  
* Agile approach – get business value delivered as quickly as possible consistent with right quality   
* Burn down chart – remaining work line is below the expected work line – project ahead of schedule  ( team is able to complete more than planned )  
* Burn up chart shows the change in the story points ( BDown doesn’t)   
* Burn up chart – total story pt line has gone up on 5th day – new US added to sprint  
* Planning too  much in the future is a waste of effort as the future may change   
* Daily stand up benefits – surface the problems early  
* Role of SM in DS call – taking notes and resolving the impediments faced by team   
* JIT used for no rework in plan and accommodate changes in the system   
* Fixed price contracts – add additional conditions to the contract  
* There will be lots of uncertainty at the beginning of the project which gets reduced as we progress
