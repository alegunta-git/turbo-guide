* In your opinion, how does this company compare to its major competitors, like Activate, Pump, and Dragon Works?
* In preparing for the interview you should have researched  the prospective employer. When  you ask this question, you are saying to the interviewer 
* “Look at the research I’ve done. I know who your competitors are.” The answer to this question will also help you learn more about the company.
* I know you sell hair-care products. What are the demographics of your customers?
* Your reason for asking this question is similar to your reason for asking the prior one. If you have experience with the demographic this company targets, that is something you can talk about in your thank-you letter or in any follow-up interviews.
* Why is this opportunity available?
* In what way will you know you made the right decision after the first 90 days?
* What makes you happy when you arrive at the office each morning?

**Qs Never To Ask**
* How much money will I make?
* Money should never be discussed on a job interview. You should hold off on discussing salary until you receive a job offer, when you will be able to negotiate. Even if the employer brings it up first, it is best to avoid getting into an extensive conversation about it at this point.
* What are the health benefits like?
* While you may need this information to help you decide whether or not to accept a job offer, the interview isn’t the time to obtain it. Hold off on this discussion until you receivea job offer. The person interviewing you may not even know a lot about company benefits other than those he has.
* How much vacation time will I have?
* You haven’t even started working and already you want to know about time off. Your goal  during the interview is to demonstrate to the employer that you will be a productive employee.Asking about vacation time will not help you reach that goal.
* Can I take time off for religious observance?
* An employer is required by law to give you time off for religious observance, so you have no reason to ask about it during the interview. It should never be brought up in the interview usually anytime before you begin working
