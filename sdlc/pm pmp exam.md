Big Qs  fragment – reframe Q – select option

Probable causes of delay : Unclear Objectives , disorganized , inability to say NO , Interruptions , periods of inactivity

Stress and fatigue : all work and no play 

DNA : Disengage , negotiate and agree (Don’t force things on people) 

When \+ What \= Scchedule completion 

RBS – available and not available ( then go to mgmt.)pictorial format no email and writing 

Effort time ,idle time 

8 hrs – 1 hr lunch , 6 hr work , other meeting 

PERT , optimistic – risks reduced , no constraints , Most likely – dependencies on past experience Pessimistic – resource availability , resource productivity , all types of risks ( worst case scenario)

Less range , less risk 

Be real cool with statisitcs and scheduling and MS project move towards the median 

What best we can do , what worst can happen

Skill of discovering constraints 

**Top Manager and Sr Manager paid mode to handle constraints and Risks** 

Estimations affected by Perceptions and constraints 

40% of employees work on non critical activities in every company

Use network diagrams to convince Top Mgmt(Fish Market)

Lack of resource availability (overstaying)

Make 2 schedule ( unlevelled and levelled ) – negotiate with mgmt. 

Fast tracking ( work more , cut requests )  more qs on fast tracking and crashing 

Create tolerances before creating a plan (max and min)

**Every Seller organization does bottom up estiamtion**

Estimates give range 

| Profit Margin |
| :---- |
| Fixed Costs and Overhead Costs |
| Risk Buffer |
| Direct Costs , variables Costs  |

Probability is the language of estimations

Total uncertainty – general uncertainty – specific uncertainty – total certainty 

Risk is uncertainity 

How to manage risks through people by taking decisions and actions 

Risk taking is a must for survival (learn how to systematically manage uncertainities)

Take corrective action – investigate – root cause analysis – fishbone diagram 

Skill to ask Why Questions 

Karma , ostrich head egg syndrome 

**Many Project suffer due to lack of follow up** 

Low risk – TL can don High Risk Quantitative analysis

How to split time

| 10 % Meeting | 60% risk management | 30% Motivation and Team building |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

You cant drive a car by looking back 

All (feasibility 65% , high level plan 75% , micro plan 80%)

**Fallback plan ( very High Risk ) , Workaround( Fire fighting ) , Corrective action**

Common to JW and GSR – Time management

Now I understand JW used to ask for 90% confidence level 

U can survive as TL w/o using Fishbone diagram ,wef Mgr learn it 

**PMI Qs Don’t ask for Corrective actions Focus is on Preventing Problems**

Key soft skills for Mgmt career – GM skills , deal with people , deal with groups 

**80 % problems due to miscommunication and lack of authority**

Power – Referrent (Matrix) , Reward , Legitimate , Punishment , Expert 

Confrontation , Negotiation , Collaboration , Compromise , Withdrawal , Forcing (Don’t force stuff on people) , Smoothing  Pamper 

S T C 

Scope – Deliverables 

Time – Milestones

C – Effort 

Manage projects better by EVM and not with supervision 

Project completion , Budget spent , Time 

**PM Should focus on Completion**

**IF SV \= 0 , On target as on date , SV \> 0 ahead of schedule , SV \< 0 behind schedule**

CPI 0.85 to 1.15 (Control Costs0

CPI \<0.80 Control things 

CPI \< 0.75 working hard – plan defective 

CPI \> 1.2 fast track

**Weekly Review meeting | dashboard**

1. Discuss future tense  
2. Identify probable causes(take action)  
3. Delegate to junior ( take actions )   
4. Pls plan meetings

Where we have been , where are we now , where will be going

Original Base line \+ approved changes \= new base line

**Take a decision kya karna go to manager – evaluate options – fast tracking and crashing** 

Don’t go to mgmt. team w/o doing homework 

Analogous estimates wild guess bottom best 

PM is  layman ( manages projects) cant be an expert , use collaboration (don’t enforce) PM Cannot say do this (use discussion)

50% of execution issues – personality conflicts 

Program Manager – not technical , handle other departments 

**Project manager – become a good manager , getting things done**

Only technology – your reach will be reduced

**Cannot get expertise by reading books , need to deal with the constraints**

**Morale cannot be resolved in meetings**

**Hiring and Promoting based on Halo effect**

PMP pretenders vs PMP professional ( look at questions – identify the problem – don’t jump to choices ) 

PM role is managerial – sympathize but at same time get things done 

FP any rework needs to be prevented 

Buyer 

* Have they understood our needs

**Ignorance is not expected in PM , Compliance is Very Imp , quality guy will review**

Issue – escalate – give recommendations

**QA 3 tools**

* Audit   
* Walk throughs  
* Peer reviews ( verify check)

**QC – 2 reports**

1. TM (Fix bugs)  
2. Mgmr ( cause of bugs , why , RCA)

**Requiring** 

1. Trend graphs   
2. Why bugs   
3. Where they occur   
4. Priorities – how to solve 

A lot of things at Mgmt – Halo effect and resume factor 

Marketing him – don’t say he is bad 

**People want responsibility but fail to take ‘decisions’**

**People want Authority  but fail to take ‘action’**

Good listener – vent off feelings (don’t let him carry emotions)

**Never say a bad word mother : my child is best (never say about mistakes)**

People want justice not goody good 

**PM has to be a very good listener**

**Hard work mind is a slave body** 

**Fine sir and ok sir**

**360 – what others feel about you** 

**Resume – what you feel about  yours**

Execution – Manage team , Manage stakeholders 

With Organization nal resources , by planning / scheduling / controlling / directing resources 

Through gadhas and godhas 

**Best Managed Project**

* First 2/3 pressure on project  
* Last 1/3 pressure should not be on Team ( poor quality issues)  
* Credibility is important from strategic point of view and in order to be credible project team has to deliver 

| WBS | Time(Schedule) Cost | Constraints |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |

**Scope Verification**

* Verify work against specification / standards   
* Approved by Quality Team  
* Happens when you produce deliverables  
* Complies with *documented acceptance criteria ( from internal / external customers and stakeholders)*

* Check variances against WBS / activities list   
* *Schedule Controls*  
  * Remove constraints  
  * Minimize risk  
  * All cost and time estimates based on Mean not Mode and Median  
* More questions on Preventive action   
  * Prevention : ensure earlier detection   
  * Inspection : prevent occurrence of errors before reaching customers  
  * Things from business point of view  
    * Trend graphs ( is process improving)  
    * Mgmt report send to check why bugs are occurring   
    * Process 6 sigma where problems are occurring   
    * Frequency of occurrence   
    * **Priorities: where we should act first**  
    * Scatter diagram : correlation issues  
* Close out  
  * Acceptance critieria  
  * Exit critieria  
  * Gain formal acceptance   
  * Check we have met customers expectations and objectives  
  * For Seller Organisation – Having a WBS really helpful in assessing for work done and claiming the amount   
    * US CO – lack of WBS resulted in 8 yrs of effort and 15% amount payment due to amicable settlement  
* Misc  
  * PM Don’t pass the buck   
  * Maintain integrity , tell some technical sry we cannot do , get back to you  
* Why Do we fail  
  * Coward

  * We cheat  
  * We don’t believe in planning   
  * We are optimistic by default   
  * We steal   
  * We try to make it up

**Clients want the Best and Least Expensive**

On Companies with less matured PM Process – Slippages ( Cost 20% , Time 40%)

Project Management is a Discipline which requires ‘DISCIPLINE’

PMP exam – Tests for ( Team , Risk , Stakeholders)

5 hrs \* 20 days / m \* 12 m / yr \= 1200 hrs / yr ( 4-4.5 yrs) 

Imp Soft Skill ( Planning – Call a team meeting , Expedite phase : Don’t call a Team meeting) 

I think / I might decision – ‘Risk Management’ Document it as someone wants to change – need to verify and evaluate check 

Past , Present : Verify / Evaluate , Future : Decision /Plan

PMIBOK – PMI Proceses , Terminology , Formula ( Pert / EVM ) 

**Program Manager**

## As per GSR  {#as-per-gsr}

* **Jobs**  
  * Most people have ‘Tiffin Carrier’ and NOT ‘Career’ on the day job  
  * 60% people by birth are followers , 20% are resistors and 20% are Leader  
  * 90% \- No Goals , 7% have goals but don’t write them , 3% \- written goals  
  * Fear of rejection and failure (Risk Averse and Conformance)  
  * Beyond 10 yrs , its not your CV it is your ability to ‘perform’ on the job as a Manager that will help you to gain Promotion and move ahead  
  * Every 8-10 yrs , organization would like to shed / churn the workforce , so if you have been an engineer , transition to a PM/GM Role   
    * Your first 3 yeaars in the initial 10 yrs will be given to you , whether you look good bad or ugly and whether you are lousy or ambitious   
    * Next shift from TL to PM involves a transition period of 2 yrs , where you need to shed your technical skin and become comfy with ‘Project Management’ skill  
    * As a GM you need to be broad based strategic and highly efficient wrt Operations and Execution  
    * Nimbu nichodke kaam nikal wana hai sir engg se ( aggressive and authority)  
  * Life – 90% maintenance , 5% \- Happiness , 5% \- sadness  
* **PMI Exam Preparation**

  * Execution \= Strategy , Operations and People 


## PMI ACP Exam Notes
* The Agile Manifesto was developed with Software Developers in the mind  
* If your Manager asks to start a project without a valid contract from the Customer – create an impact analysis of starting the project without the contract  
* Agile project deliver reliable results by enaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership  
* Process of defining abd documenting stakeholders needs to meet project objecitves is called collect requirements  
* Developing detailed description of project and product is called define scope   
* Middle of the project and the customer Is not happy with deliverables given last week – talk to the customer , u need to understand why the customer is not happy  
* Agile way of Product development – to produce working product early and incrementally   
* Change control process – PMs top priority first try preventing unncessary changes before trying other options   
* Agile projects boost perfirmance through group accountability for results and shared responsibioity for team effectiviness  
* Customer provides the SOW as part of bidding process  
* SOW \= Business need , Prouct scope description and Strategic plan ( not cost estimation)  
* Corrective action – documented direction for executing the project work to bring expected future performance of the project work in line with the PM plan  
* Preventive action – documented directions to perform an activity that can reduce the probability of negative consequences associated with project risks  
* Defect repair – recommendtion o repair the defect  
* Work performance information – deliveravle status , schedule progress , cost incurred   
* Project execution most of the budget is spent   
* Iteration retrospective is for the last completed iteration – so something new in each iteration  
* Middle of project and resource are not available –so make an impact plan on the project due to non availability of resources( wrong ans stopthe work  inform customer etc)  
* Integration is the key responsibility of PM   
*   
* Agile teams – 8 to 12 , cross functional and self organizing

* 11 stakholders , 55 comms channels   
* Distance , noise , language – communication barrier   
* Push communication ( letterss reports and press release ) push the informaion to receiver , pull out the information from sender  
* Tracking the project result over time to see performance is improving or deteriorating – trend reports   
* Information radiator provide quick and easy update to all stakeholders  
* Forecasting methods – judgement , time series , econometric , variance analysis comapre the current state with the baseline or expected state ( not forecast)  
* Agile free flow of face to face info \+ lean but sufficient  documentation   
* Comm barriers lead to conflict  
* Stand up meeting short and structures

* Agile team productivity metrics – cycle time  release burn down , customer support  
* Fail fast – agile philosophy  
* Project data sheet – 1p – key project information , business objectives , product capabilities   
* Stpries are cutomer centric , describing the results in business

* Agile methods principles – customer involvement  incremental delivery , people not process  system is deigned for change  
* Empirical process – visibility , inspection anfd adaptation   
* User Stories  
  * Customer focused , domain experts write US , use the simplest tool (index card) , write in simple language ,   
  * include unique story number , include the priority number , include the estimated size   
  * INVEST – Independent , Negotiable , Valuable , Estimable , Sized properly , Testable   
* Epics , Features and User Stories

  * Time and Materials contract  
    * Suitable for agile , client pays for the hours – team members customer may seek a trial period of 6 months , customer trust the skill level / experience of vendor , review every 6 months , hike by 5% evert year   
* Charts  
  * Sprint Burn down and Burn Up  
  * Release burn down and burn up   
  * Cumulative flow diagram   
  * Lead time \= wIP (units) / Average completion rate ( units per time period)  
  * Work in Progress \= Lead time \* Average completion rate (units)  
  * Average Completion rate \= WIP / Lead time   
  * EV of the release \= Sum of EV of iterations   
  * Kanban Board (Tasks / Feature / Stories)  
* Retrospectives   
  * Process improvements , team in self improving mode   
  * Collaborative process all memvers of team  
  * www and wci   
  * actions and lessons are prioritized based on teams direction   
  * works out solutions for most prominent problems   
    * Process  
      * Set the stage ( working arrangement , ground rules)  
      * Gather data ( relevant data , sahred picture)  
      * Generate insights ( time to ask why , time to ask how )   
      * Decide what to do ( action plan , impediments)  
      * Close retro ( Say thanks and Appreciate)  
      * Start doing , stop doing , continue doing  
* Agile planning adaptive and iterative  
* Role of PO provide input on the business value for effective prioritization of requirements  
* Whole team to be considered for repriortiization  consider both business value and technical feasibility  
* Agile approach – get business value delivered as quickly as possible consistent with right quality   
* Burn down chart – remaining work line is below the expected work line – project ahead of schedule  ( team is able to complete more than planned )  
* Burn up chart shows the change in the story points ( BDown doesn’t)   
* Burn up chart – total story pt line has gone up on 5th day – new US added to sprint  
* Planning too  much in the future is a waste of effort as the future may change   
* Daily stand up benefits – surface the problems early  
* Role of SM in DS call – taking notes and resolving the impediments faced by team   
* JIT used for no rework in plan and accommodate changes in the system   
* Fixed price contracts – add additional conditions to the contract  
* There will be lots of uncertainty at the beginning of the project which gets reduced as we progress  
* Extrapolate velocity – slowest , average , fastest   
* Estimating Styles  
  * Subjective ( personal experience)  
  * Stasticsial ( historical data)  
  * Comparative estimate( similar projects)  
  * Empirical estimate(real data)  
* Order of Magnitude( \-25 to 75\) earyli in lifecycle , Budgetary( \-10 to 25\) , definitive ( \-5 to 10\)  
* Consensus and Consultative style   
* If a new requirements emerges – iteration in progress – assess for business value- impr to biz – add to backlog and relacing with less important requirements   
* While prioritizing user stories – consider Value , Cost , Risk  
* Cost of quality   
  * Preventive costs  
    * Planning , vendor suveys  
    * Training and induction  
    * Requirements and design reviews  
    * Code reviews
