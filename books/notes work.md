**"Here Are The Nine Differences Listed By The American Family:**
1. Honking: In America, honking means someone is about to lose their mind, but in India, a honk means, "Hi, I am here, look out, thanks".
2. Food: In America, spicy means mild heat, but in India, spicy could cause some digestive issues, especially for foreigners.
3. People: In the USA, people pretend you don't exist. In India, people will absolutely ask where you are from, where you are going, and why.
4. Trash: While trash is placed in trash cans in the USA, the same can't be said about India, where it goes wherever the nearest person decides.
5. Cars: Driving your own car is the default, and you follow the traffic laws in US, but India has controlled chaos on the road that outsiders would not understand.
6. Weather: America - winter, spring, summer, fall in most places; India: hot, monsoon, and "surprise extra heat" season.
7. Religion: America - Mostly catholic churches and quiet gatherings; India: Temples everywhere and festivals that take over entire cities.
8. Affordability: Haakenson said everything is expensive in the US but in India, everything was manageable.
9. Family: America - Single-family living; India - multiple generations under one roof"
