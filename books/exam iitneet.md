**How to crack NEET**
1. **Remember for competitive exam, time is limited and one can't afford to waste it here and there.(8am to 10pm)**
1. Study Schedule , Study plan , freq revision session, Solve numerical pbm , draw diagram , mnemonics 
1. PYQ :check hidden info , eliminate incorrect option, Id weak area , review mistakes 
1. Skim entire q paper, prioritize qs , id easy qs , Skip difficult qs initially , use shortcuts approx , avoid overthinking second guessing 
1. There is none who can pay you for your hours spent sitting on table and chair with the book.
1. _You will be only paid for the pages read and remembered and that too pages selected carefully and not interestingly_.
1. If a person selects one subject and read all the books written on one subject, he can not clear a competitive exam. 
1. Rather who can remember physics/chemistry 60/60% and biology 80 per- cent will get better rank.
1. If you are not able to understand something just cram or leave it , you are not supposed to do research(rca fail : overenthusiasm)

**THE ULTIMATE GUIDE TO USE PHYSICS WALLAH APP**
