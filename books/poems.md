## Poems 
* Robert Frost
* Matthew 7:7 
  * "Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; 
  * knock and the door will be opened to you.For everyone who asks."
* Recourse to Shakespeare to emphasize that tomorrow belongs to the people who prepare for it today
  * There is a tide in the affaris of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune 
  * Omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries
  * On such a full sea ae we now afloat , And we must take the current when it serves , or Lose our ventures
