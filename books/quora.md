**NewbieChallenges**
* https://www.quora.com/Do-you-feel-that-new-software-developers-hires-are-unprepared-for-jobs

**You will experience some or all of the following for the first time :**
- Big systems ,  Complex subject matter , Deadlines
- Merge hell , Test automation , TDD for real
- Vague bug reports , Unreproducible bugs ,  Bugs that cannot be fixed
- Estimating things you do not understand
- Large codebases , Bad code , Legacy systems integration , Faulty APIs , Code standards you disagree with
- Unfamiliar tool chains , Continuous Integration , Misused technology, 
- Misleading documentation , Misleading dead code , Insufficient permissions , 
- Micromanagement , Unsatisfying work , Performance reviews
- Heavy management processes , BAs, PMs, QAs , Unreasonable colleagues
- It really is overwhelming. It is nothing like the typical Computer Science degree at all.


**What are some important, but uncomfortable truths that many people learn when transitioning into adulthood?**
- Every person is responsible for their own happiness -- not their parents, not their boss, not their spouse, not their friends, not their government, not their deity.
- Practically all of the best opportunities (in business, in romance, etc) are only offered to people who already have more than they need.
- The idea that you will be happy after you make X amount of dollars is almost certainly an illusion., The idea that you will be happy after you meet [some amazing person] is almost certainly an illusion.
- When you don't possess leverage (go look up "BATNA"), people will take advantage of you, whether they mean to or not.
- Almost everybody is making it up as they go along. Also, many (most?) people are incompetent at their jobs.
- When talking about their background and accomplishments, almost everybody is continually overstating their abilities, impact, relevance, and contributions.
- Very few people will ever give you 100% candid, honest feedback.
- Certain people -- some of whom are in positions of enormous power -- just do not give a damn about other human beings.

**What are some useful computer related technical skills I can learn within a day?**
- Learn how to use Git and GitHub
- Learn how to use SVN
- Learn simple linux regular expressions
- Find a site with a few interview programming questions, and practice going through the full answer, with code, for some of them (a few a day should be good; do them in a language you don't know well if you already can ace most).
- Set up a crawler that can scrape some webpages and parse some basic data.
- Set up a bigger crawler that has to fill out a form or two.
- Program a basic linear algebra library (matrices, vectors, multiplication)
- Add SVD to this library , Add matrix inversion to this library
- Add least squares regression to this library
- Make your library work efficiently with sparse data.
- Learn how to use list comprehensions in python.
-  Read the freaking manual for your favorite language. In the past I've wasted hours in Python because I didn't know that the Counter data structure existed, and kept getting the bugs from using Dicts as Counters. There are many examples like this.
- Get a stackoverflow account and learn to use the site. If you don't at least know that StackOverflow is an available resource, and you're an english-speaking programmer, you're doing it wrong.
- Implement a simple Machine learning algorithm on your own, with a whole pipeline. I.e. you read a simple input csv, split it into training and test set, run a simple algorithm with readily-tuneable or explorable hyperparameters, and a simple output of relevant statistics.
- Learn the how to make a simple line graph in Excel, and make sure you can do it right; i.e. properly labeled axes and tick marks, title and legends.
- Learn how to make a simple line graph in something other than Excel. Make sure you can do it right (same requirements).
- Get your eclipse installation fully pumped up: python dev tools, c dev tools, any other language you could ever write in, and make sure you can write a hello world successfully in each perspective. It'll save you time some future day.
- Learn the basic functionality of a NoSQL database; (you can learn a big chunk of mongoDB in a day)
- Learn the most basic functionality of SQL (you don't need to be a query guru,  but have a small clue about it).
- Learn a tool for in-depth parsing of HTML and XML
- Implement a list-of-lists graph data structure
- Implement random walk, PageRank, clustering coefficient finding (#triangles over possible triangles) and common neighbor number finding.
- Implement BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, topological sort and Minimum Spanning Tree (bonus for union-find version). Take a couple days if you have no algorithms background.
- Make a simple java applet that has at least some interaction with listeners and not just buttons and such.
