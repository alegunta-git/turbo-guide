that there could only be a few leaders to create wealth. And that it’s the job of the government to create an environment

After admitting he uses ChatGPT, Narayana Murthy says management and technology graduates are same for him - India Today 

Different approaches, shared goals in problem-solving
The 78-year-old industry pioneer outlined the distinct yet interconnected roles each group plays in organisational success. "One asks 'what,' while the other focuses on 'how.' Technical people look at 'how,' and the management graduates look at 'what,'" he clarified, highlighting how both perspectives are essential for comprehensive problem-solving.

**NRI moves to Bengaluru, shocked by colleagues' eating, zero exercise: ‘Running on chai and trauma’ | Trending**
"In his post, the employee wrote that he shifted to Bengaluru a few weeks ago and was surprised to see his entire team “grinding like crazy” at work while surviving on Mysore bondas, vadas and biryani “literally every hour”. He added that his colleagues take “zero steps, zero sunlight and zero water” during the day.

According to him, he began going to the gym before work to stay mentally balanced, but said his co-workers looked at him “like I’m doing a TED talk” whenever he mentioned fitness. He said he wanted to encourage the team to adopt basic health habits. '' I really wanna push my team towards basic health stuff without sounding like that NRI clown,'' he added"

## CBSE exam prep
"Preparation plays a crucial role, but how one prepares matters more than how much. Do not learn by simply reading solutions. Solve problems and keep writing formulas. Last-minute cramming often increases anxiety and confusion. Instead, revise key formulas, standard results, and frequently tested concepts to reinforce confidence. Solve a few representative problems from each chapter, as this is far more effective than hurriedly attempting many new ones just before the exam. The more the practice, the faster the calculation pace during the examination."

**Elon Musk's 'wake-up call' for America echoes what brother Kimbal Musk said on Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' - The Times of India**
Solar power in China will exceed ALL sources of electricity combined in the USA in 3 to 4 years. Wake up call,” Musk said in a post which showed data from Ember, a global energy think tank. Ember’s data chart suggests China's solar output hit 100 TWh in May 2025 and is doubling every two years, outpacing the US's 400

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

**Movies Ups and Downs**
"Talking to SCREEN, Mona recalled meeting Aamir and director Advait Chandan on the movie’s release day at Aamir’s home. She was emotional and admitted, “I was crying, of course; I always begin to weep in such moments. And it’s for the good only, as it loosens up the heart and cleanses your mind of all the worries.” During this time, Aamir reminded her, “This is what the movie business is about; you get just one Friday to prove yourself.” She felt the pressure of that statement deeply, explaining, “I was really like, this is not done. That one Friday is the only day when people decide whether it’s good or bad; that’s so much pressure for anyone to take.” Reflecting on this, she expressed her preference for OTT platforms now, saying, “That’s why I enjoy OTT now; people can watch your stuff whenever you want.”"


**BJP leader Amarinder Singh calls BJP ‘rigid,’ praises Congress’s flexibility - The Hindu** 
"Talking to select media, Mr. Singh said “..Punjab is a different area. Look at it, everywhere the BJP is pulling through, why not in Punjab? See previous elections, how many seats have some, hardly any.”

Elaborating on the reasons, he added, “And the reason is that you (BJP) don’t consult people who have been in the field, who know what to say. The decisions are taken at the upper level, even in the Congress, the decisions were taken at the top level, but they used to consult us, everyone – MLAs, MPs’ views were taken. Here (BJP), I don’t think anyone has asked.”

Responding to a question does he misses Congress, Mr. Singh said “No, the system there was different, I miss the system. A broader type of consultation used to take place there (Congress) and there was a value of experience, which is lacking here (BJP). Congress is more flexible in taking views, the BJP, I find, is a bit rigid in its approach.”"

**"Here Are The Nine Differences Listed By The American Family:**
1. Honking: In America, honking means someone is about to lose their mind, but in India, a honk means, "Hi, I am here, look out, thanks".
2. Food: In America, spicy means mild heat, but in India, spicy could cause some digestive issues, especially for foreigners.
3. People: In the USA, people pretend you don't exist. In India, people will absolutely ask where you are from, where you are going, and why.
4. Trash: While trash is placed in trash cans in the USA, the same can't be said about India, where it goes wherever the nearest person decides.
5. Cars: Driving your own car is the default, and you follow the traffic laws in US, but India has controlled chaos on the road that outsiders would not understand.
6. Weather: America - winter, spring, summer, fall in most places; India: hot, monsoon, and "surprise extra heat" season.
7. Religion: America - Mostly catholic churches and quiet gatherings; India: Temples everywhere and festivals that take over entire cities.
8. Affordability: Haakenson said everything is expensive in the US but in India, everything was manageable.
9. Family: America - Single-family living; India - multiple generations under one roof"

**"The mentor’s playbook**
Speaking recently on The Gstaad Guy Podcast with Gustaf Lundberg Toresson, Schmidt shared that this practice was first encouraged by his mentor, the late Bill Campbell, the legendary “coach” to Silicon Valley’s top leaders. Each weekend, Schmidt carves out time to think, write, and plan the coming week — without distractions, phones, or notifications."

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary

**Oct 21 AWS outage**
"The global cloud market is dominated by three companies. AWS holds the largest share (roughly 30 per cent), followed by Microsoft Azure (20 per cent) and Google Cloud Platform (13 per cent).

All three service providers have had recent outages, significantly impacting digital service platforms. In 2024, an issue with third-party software severely impacted Microsoft Azure, causing extensive operational failures for businesses globally. Google Cloud Platform also experienced a major outage this year due to an internal misconfiguration"


**Indian-origin Cisco executive works 18 hours, 7 days a week but has ‘two non-negotiable’ work-life balance rules | Trending News - The Indian Express**
"As reported by Fortune, Patel works every single day of the week. His mornings begin around 6 am, and it is not unusual for him to still be working close to midnight. Even so, he follows one strict rule: no meetings before 9 am, unless they come directly from Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins or the company’s board. Those early hours are reserved for deep work and mapping out priorities.

“Picking the highest quality problems that you want to spend your time solving is 90% of the battle,” he told Fortune. “Because the quality of the problem that you pick to solve is actually directly proportional to the outcome that you’re going to have.”"

"Health is another non-negotiable for him. Patel admits he’s not obsessed with fitness, but he makes sure to exercise at least 20–30 minutes a day. What matters, he says, is consistency, especially when every day in tech looks different from the last. “I’m not in great shape, but I’m not in terrible shape,” he joked, acknowledging that he often has to recalibrate and start again."

**Steve Jobs’ ‘strong message’ to engineers that remained Apple's guiding doctrine**
"Apple founder Steve Jobs once told the company engineers that the people who make real breakthroughs are not just thinkers, but also doers. In the early 1990s, Jobs addressed Apple engineers where he said “The doers are the major thinkers”, further citing Leonrado Da Vinci. He added “Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side thinking five years out what he would paint? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints.”"

**Jensen Huang**
"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently opened up about his personal use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, saying he switches between platforms depending on the tasks. Speaking at an interview in London recently, Huang said that among Elon Musk’s Grok, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google’s Gemini, his favorite “depends on what I’m doing”. Explaining further, the Nvidia CEO said “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT”."

IndiGo restores 2,200 flights; CEO says 'worst is behind us' - [Rediff.com](http://rediff.com/) https://www.rediff.com/news/report/indigo-restores-2200-flights-ceo-says-worst-is-behind-us/20251218.htm

**"Dec 09 2025 , IndiGo cuts 400-500 flights to achieve ‘full stabilisation of schedule’**
Indigo will now operate 1,800-1,900 flights instead of 2,300 flights it used to operate daily

**Government may seek reconstitution of IndiGo’s board over FDTL fallout** 
"Sources added that given the dependence of the Indian aviation industry on the IndiGo network, which accounts for 65 percent of market share, it is advisable to have more people on the board who can question network design, crew utilisation, rostering, aircraft ground time and regulatory exposure with domain authority, so that operational risk gets board-level visibility rather than remaining buried within the managerial layers.

**When I signed up to make deliveries on Zomato, Blinkit and Swiggy for a day | Long Reads News - The Indian Express**
"For three days last week, I signed up as a delivery worker, navigating Delhi’s traffic and the architecture of India’s gig economy. My experience of working for a day each across Zomato, Blinkit and Swiggy platforms laid bare a grim reality: India’s convenience economy runs on the backs of delivery workers, and the costs – financial, physical, psychological – are theirs alone to carry.

The numbers were stark. Across three days, I rode 105 km on a TVS 125 cc scooter to complete more than 20 deliveries and clocked over 15 hours of work. Total earnings: Rs 782. After fuel costs of Rs 250, I was left with Rs 532, or roughly Rs 34 per hour — well below minimum wage standards in most formal sectors — without accounting for vehicle maintenance, phone bills, or the physical toll of spending hours navigating Delhi’s roads, waiting for orders and lugging heavy loads up buildings."

With a low base pay (around Rs 35-Rs 55 per order, depending on distance), algorithmic systems that nudge delivery workers to accept more orders and cover longer distances, rising fuel costs, no social security benefits and a largely faceless management, the growth of India’s quick-delivery economy — which is expected to employ over 23 million by 2030 — has come at the cost of increasingly precarious worker earnings.


**Tavleen Singh writes: Money spent on Davos holidays could be used to clean up our cities | The Indian Express**
"The reason why the richest people in the world are happy to pay to attend the WEF annual meeting is because for that one week it is as if Davos becomes the centre of the world. Everything new that is happening in technology, urbanisation, governance and geopolitics is discussed. I remember sending my first email in Davos at a time when the world knew almost nothing about the Internet. Then when AI came along, it was in Davos that its implications were discussed by the world’s leading experts."

"If our politicians attended these sessions where the most important issues of the day are discussed and came home with new ideas, it might be worth allowing them to go. They attend only the sessions in which they are participants because they think of themselves as too grand to listen to other people. There are exceptions who genuinely go to learn about the world’s changes and new developments, but I can count them on the fingers of one hand.

As someone who remembers the WEF annual meeting from 30 years ago, trust me when I tell you that so few Indians came then that Rahul Bajaj, one of the first Indians to go to Davos, would have a small dinner for the Indian contingent on the day we arrived. There were rarely any politicians in attendance and those that did come were misfits and embarrassing. Meaningless, meandering speeches are not encouraged in Davos and rarely heard. But it was these that our chief ministers came armed with, clearly written by bureaucrats who never learned the word precis. It was truly mortifying to see them ramble on aimlessly."



**OpenAI CEO Sam Altman to startup founders: ‘No one cares about your...'; urges them to focus on execution.**
"He said even if a detailed plan were handed directly to a major industry leader, the chances of it being copied meaningfully are low because successful execution requires focus, persistence, and real-world problem solving.

Altman’s core message was simple: ideas are abundant, but building something that works — and continues to work — is what truly creates value."
