**Steve Jobs’ ‘strong message’ to engineers that remained Apple's guiding doctrine**
"Apple founder Steve Jobs once told the company engineers that the people who make real breakthroughs are not just thinkers, but also doers. In the early 1990s, Jobs addressed Apple engineers where he said “The doers are the major thinkers”, further citing Leonrado Da Vinci. He added “Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side thinking five years out what he would paint? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints.”"

**Jensen Huang**

Speaking at an interview in London recently, Huang said that among Elon Musk’s Grok, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google’s Gemini, his favorite “depends on what I’m doing”. Explaining further, the Nvidia CEO said “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT”."

Different approaches, shared goals in problem-solving

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary


**Elon Musk's 'wake-up call' for America echoes what brother Kimbal Musk said on Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' - The Times of India**

Solar power in China will exceed ALL sources of electricity combined in the USA in 3 to 4 years. Wake up call,” Musk said in a post which showed data from Ember, a global energy think tank. Ember’s data chart suggests China's solar output hit 100 TWh in May 2025 and is doubling every two years, outpacing the US's 400

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

'Not a magnet for science...': Nobel laureate warns India can’t lure global talent, slams R&D woes - BusinessToday

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

**An economy allergic to failure': Tech CEO says UPSC is where India buries its ambition - BusinessToday**

"With its vast syllabus, unpredictable questions, and multi-stage eliminations, UPSC demands immense intellectual energy. But Singhal’s point is clear: that same energy could help power India’s next wave of innovation—if it weren’t stuck in exam halls.

“India doesn’t lack talent,” he concluded. “Its efforts are misplaced.”"

**Oct 21 AWS outage**

**Movies Ups and Downs**
"Talking to SCREEN, Mona recalled meeting Aamir and director Advait Chandan on the movie’s release day at Aamir’s home. She was emotional and admitted, “I was crying, of course; I always begin to weep in such moments. And it’s for the good only, as it loosens up the heart and cleanses your mind of all the worries.” During this time, Aamir reminded her, “This is what the movie business is about; you get just one Friday to prove yourself.” She felt the pressure of that statement deeply, explaining, “I was really like, this is not done. That one Friday is the only day when people decide whether it’s good or bad; that’s so much pressure for anyone to take.” Reflecting on this, she expressed her preference for OTT platforms now, saying, “That’s why I enjoy OTT now; people can watch your stuff whenever you want.”"

**NRI moves to Bengaluru, shocked by colleagues' eating, zero exercise: ‘Running on chai and trauma’ | Trending**
"In his post, the employee wrote that he shifted to Bengaluru a few weeks ago and was surprised to see his entire team “grinding like crazy” at work while surviving on Mysore bondas, vadas and biryani “literally every hour”. He added that his colleagues take “zero steps, zero sunlight and zero water” during the day.

According to him, he began going to the gym before work to stay mentally balanced, but said his co-workers looked at him “like I’m doing a TED talk” whenever he mentioned fitness.

**BJP leader Amarinder Singh calls BJP ‘rigid,’ praises Congress’s flexibility - The Hindu** 
"Talking to select media, Mr. Singh said “..Punjab is a different area. Look at it, everywhere the BJP is pulling through, why not in Punjab? See previous elections, how many seats have some, hardly any.”

Elaborating on the reasons, he added, “And the reason is that you (BJP) don’t consult people who have been in the field, who know what to say. The decisions are taken at the upper level, even in the Congress, the decisions were taken at the top level, but they used to consult us, everyone – MLAs, MPs’ views were taken. Here (BJP), I don’t think anyone has asked.”

Responding to a question does he misses Congress, Mr. Singh said “No, the system there was different, I miss the system. A broader type of consultation used to take place there (Congress) and there was a value of experience, which is lacking here (BJP). Congress is more flexible in taking views, the BJP, I find, is a bit rigid in its approach.”"

**Indian-origin Cisco executive works 18 hours, 7 days a week but has ‘two non-negotiable’ work-life balance rules | Trending News - The Indian Express**
"As reported by Fortune, Patel works every single day of the week. His mornings begin around 6 am, and it is not unusual for him to still be working close to midnight. Even so, he follows one strict rule: no meetings before 9 am, unless they come directly from Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins or the company’s board. Those early hours are reserved for deep work and mapping out priorities.

“Picking the highest quality problems that you want to spend your time solving is 90% of the battle,” he told Fortune. “Because the quality of the problem that you pick to solve is actually directly proportional to the outcome that you’re going to have.”"

"Health is another non-negotiable for him. Patel admits he’s not obsessed with fitness, but he makes sure to exercise at least 20–30 minutes a day. What matters, he says, is consistency, especially when every day in tech looks different from the last. “I’m not in great shape, but I’m not in terrible shape,” he joked, acknowledging that he often has to recalibrate and start again."

**Government may seek reconstitution of IndiGo’s board over FDTL fallout** 
"Sources added that given the dependence of the Indian aviation industry on the IndiGo network, which accounts for 65 percent of market share, it is advisable to have more people on the board who can question network design, crew utilisation, rostering, aircraft ground time and regulatory exposure with domain authority, so that operational risk gets board-level visibility rather than remaining buried within the managerial layers.
