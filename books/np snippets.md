**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

And it’s for the good only, as it loosens up the heart and cleanses your mind of all the worries.” During this time, Aamir reminded her, “This is what the movie business is about; you get just one Friday to prove yourself.” She felt the pressure of that statement deeply, explaining, “I was really like, this is not done.

**BJP leader Amarinder Singh calls BJP ‘rigid,’ praises Congress’s flexibility - The Hindu** 
"Talking to select media, Mr. Singh said “..Punjab is a different area. Look at it, everywhere the BJP is pulling through, why not in Punjab? See previous elections, how many seats have some, hardly any.”

Elaborating on the reasons, he added, “And the reason is that you (BJP) don’t consult people who have been in the field, who know what to say. The decisions are taken at the upper level, even in the Congress, the decisions were taken at the top level, but they used to consult us, everyone – MLAs, MPs’ views were taken. Here (BJP), I don’t think anyone has asked.”

Responding to a question does he misses Congress, Mr. Singh said “No, the system there was different, I miss the system. A broader type of consultation used to take place there (Congress) and there was a value of experience, which is lacking here (BJP). Congress is more flexible in taking views, the BJP, I find, is a bit rigid in its approach.”"

**Indian-origin Cisco executive works 18 hours, 7 days a week but has ‘two non-negotiable’ work-life balance rules | Trending News - The Indian Express**
"As reported by Fortune, Patel works every single day of the week. His mornings begin around 6 am, and it is not unusual for him to still be working close to midnight. Even so, he follows one strict rule: no meetings before 9 am, unless they come directly from Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins or the company’s board. Those early hours are reserved for deep work and mapping out priorities.

“Picking the highest quality problems that you want to spend your time solving is 90% of the battle,” he told Fortune. “Because the quality of the problem that you pick to solve is actually directly proportional to the outcome that you’re going to have.”"

"Health is another non-negotiable for him. Patel admits he’s not obsessed with fitness, but he makes sure to exercise at least 20–30 minutes a day. What matters, he says, is consistency, especially when every day in tech looks different from the last. “I’m not in great shape, but I’m not in terrible shape,” he joked, acknowledging that he often has to recalibrate and start again."
