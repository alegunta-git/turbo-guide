**Steve Jobs’ ‘strong message’ to engineers that remained Apple's guiding doctrine**
"Apple founder Steve Jobs once told the company engineers that the people who make real breakthroughs are not just thinkers, but also doers. In the early 1990s, Jobs addressed Apple engineers where he said “The doers are the major thinkers”, further citing Leonrado Da Vinci. He added “Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side thinking five years out what he would paint? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints.”"

**Jensen Huang**

Speaking at an interview in London recently, Huang said that among Elon Musk’s Grok, OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Perplexity and Google’s Gemini, his favorite “depends on what I’m doing”. Explaining further, the Nvidia CEO said “For something more technical I will use Gemini. If I’m doing something where it’s a bit more artistic, I prefer Grok. If it’s very fast information access I prefer Perplexity—it does a really good job of presenting research to me. And for near everyday use I enjoy using ChatGPT”."

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary


**Elon Musk's 'wake-up call' for America echoes what brother Kimbal Musk said on Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' - The Times of India**

Solar power in China will exceed ALL sources of electricity combined in the USA in 3 to 4 years. Wake up call,” Musk said in a post which showed data from Ember, a global energy think tank. Ember’s data chart suggests China's solar output hit 100 TWh in May 2025 and is doubling every two years, outpacing the US's 400

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

**An economy allergic to failure': Tech CEO says UPSC is where India buries its ambition - BusinessToday**
