**LESS IS MORE | ART OF LIVING A MEANINGFUL LIFE | MINIMALISM: A GUIDE TO LIVE AN UNCLUTTERED LIFE**
_IMP Points_

To simplify your life with a minimalist lifestyle, it is also essential to do regular cleaning.

How often do we stop living our dreams to live the dreams of other people? Goals that are shown to us that are sold to us.

When you focus on simplifying your life and lowering your expectations, you create more space for things that really matter (health, relationships, wealth, a smile, etc.), you increase your margin (the space between your work capacity and load of work) so as not to drown at work, and life, in general, becomes much easier. Even more importantly, by simplifying your life, you can finally make room for happiness. It's always the simple things that change our lives. And these things never happen when you're looking for them. Experience will reveal answers in the rhythm that you want to do. You feel like running, but life is on a ride. That is how things happen. ~ Donald Miller The easiest way to start simplifying and lowering you expect to take two simple starting steps. Identify things that are important to you. Get rid of everything else. ALL!
