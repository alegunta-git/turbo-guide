## Snippets
Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do, so throw off the bowlines, sail away from safe harbour, catch the trade winds inyour sails. Explore, Dream, Discover.’ Mark

Charlie Munger on Reading Habit.
"Advocating for the virtue of reading, Munger said, “In my whole life, I have known no wise people (over a broad subject matter area) who didn't read all the time -- none, zero.” .
“You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads--and at how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out,” he added.



## Declutter
"In the words of Francine Jay, “Remember: you are not what you own. Storing all those books doesn’t make you any smarter; it just makes your life more cluttered.”

We must beware of a certain craze for collecting which sometimes takes possession of those who make notes.... That is a deplorable practice. —A.G. Sertillanges, O.P., The Intellectual Life

Thus, things lying around messily are reminders of tasks and goals that you haven’t achieved yet. But, these reminders are not effective reminders because your focus is scattered all over the place. When you declutter your space, you are, in effect, prioritizing your goals in your mind as well. This will help you focus much better on each goal, achieving it, and then moving on to the next.

**Writing Tool #37: Long Projects**
But also read for form. If you want to write better photo captions, read old issues of LIFE magazine. If you want to become a better explainer, read a great cookbook. If you want to  write clever headlines, read the big city tabloids. If you want to write witty short features, read Talk of the Town in The New Yorker magazine.

Breaking a big project into small parts makes it easier to start writing. Break long projects into parts,  long stories into chapters. Anne Lamott's great book "Bird by Bird" gets its title from an anecdote about her brother. At  the age of 10, he struggled with a school report on birds. Lamott describes him as  "immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead." But then, "my father sat down beside him, 
put his arm around my brother's shoulder, and said, 'Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by  bird.'"  We all need such coaching to remind us to break long projects into parts, long stories into  chapters, long chapters into episodes. Such advice is both encouraging and practical. 

Where writers gather, I often ask this question: "How many of you have ever run a marathon?"  In a group of 100, maybe one or two will raise a hand. "If properly trained and motivated, how  many of you think you could run 26 miles?" A half-dozen more. "What if I gave you 52 days to  do it, so you only had to run a half mile a day?" Most of the hands in the room go up. 
Donald Murray puts it this way: "A page a day is a book a year." 
When my children were young, I volunteered to teach writing in their elementary school.  After each class, I would scribble notes in a journal, never taking more than 10 minutes to  complete the task. What had I learned that day? How did the children respond? Why was  Bonnie not writing? After three years, I thought I might have a book in me about teaching  children to write. I had never written a book before and did not know how to begin, so I  transcribed my journal entries. The result was about 250 pages of typed text, not yet a book,  but a sturdy foundation for what was to become "Free to Write: A Journalist Teaches Young  Writers."

* Innovative thinkrs don’t retain & retrieve lots of info;they identify & create new patterns/connections that reorient/reframe what others know.
* Quality, price, service: pick two.
* Write it once.Say it twice. Do fewer things, but do them better.
* Quantify the variables , A decision is the beginning of a process, not the end of one.
* Form, storm, norm, perform.
* If your thinking is sloppy, your business will be sloppy. If you are disorganized, your business will be disorganized
* Experts know a lot, but often it is better to know how to organize, structure, and contextualize knowledge than to simply have knowledge. 
* Focus on the need, not the solution.A benefit is how it helps the customer
* One ad, one message.Do your marketing while you’re busy.
* Compete in existing markets and anticipate new ones

**80 20 Rule**
* most popular 20 percent of products account for approximately 80 percent of sales;
* 20 percent of the largest customers also account for about 80 percent of sales;
* roughly 20 percent of sales account for 80 percent of profits. 
* 80 percent of wear and tear on your carpets will occur in only 20 percent of their area, 
* 20 percent of your clothes get worn 80 percent of the time.
* For the world wide web, 75/5 relationship: 5 percent of sites attracted 75 percent of visits; 
* For movies it is 80/1 (to the nearest round number): 1 percent of movies make 80 percent of the box office gross. 
* Shorthand notation : Sir Isaac Pitman invented shorthand after finding that just 700 words made up a staggering 70 percent of conversation. Including derivatives of these words, the Dictionary lists more than half a million words. fewer than 1 percent of words make up 80 percent of word usage. This pattern is very similar to that of the movies. 20% movies make 80% revenue

Maths
* Fibonacci Series : "1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 …3rd no = sum of first two no's , Growth rate : 1.618 , 60%
* Formula for projection , x = f/ (1-f) , a typical S curve , contant - grow - plateau
* x = the factor by which to measure growth
* f = the percentage of the relevant population with the plague
* 1 – f = the percentage of the population not infected with the plague.
* Zipf’s rank/size rule (the size of American cities) 
* obey Zipf’s rank/size rule, the population of a city in any country is inversely proportional to its ranking. 
* second largest city would have half the popln of the largest; and 3rd  would have one third the people of the top city, and so on."

**Economics**
* Law of diminishing returns , 1767 , This law says that after a point, increases in effort or investment result in diminishing returns; that is, the incremental value declines. To a hungry woman, a loaf of bread has high value. ,The tenth may have very little value.
* "Simon’s theory of clumps and lumps : Why do cities organize themselves like this?  But one idea that Herbert Simon came up with nearly a half-century ago, which may well be right, is that whatever size cities start out, they will then attract to themselves a similar proportion of any subsequent increase in population. Each existing city is a ‘clump’ of whatever size. When population increases, it does so in ‘lumps,’ not just through the excess of new births over deaths, but through lumps of new arrivals (by immigration in the case of the US; in many other countries by people drifting from the countryside). But each new lump will tend to attach itself to a clump in proportion to the existing size of the lump. Simon explains this by the availability of employment, and by the observed fact that most entrepreneurs (who provide the employment) stay near where they started."

* Learn the how to make a simple line graph in Excel, and make sure you can do it right; i.e. properly labeled axes and tick marks, title and legends.
* Learn how to make a simple line graph in something other than Excel. Make sure you can do it right (same requirements).
* Get your eclipse installation fully pumped up: python dev tools, c dev tools, any other language you could ever write in, and make sure you can write a hello world successfully in each perspective. It'll save you time some future day.
