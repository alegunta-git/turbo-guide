## Declutter
"In the words of Francine Jay, “Remember: you are not what you own. Storing all those books doesn’t make you any smarter; it just makes your life more cluttered.”

“The more you have, the more you are occupied. The less you have, the more free you are.”—Mother Teresa

Thus, things lying around messily are reminders of tasks and goals that you haven’t achieved yet. But, these reminders are not effective reminders because your focus is scattered all over the place. When you declutter your space, you are, in effect, prioritizing your goals in your mind as well. This will help you focus much better on each goal, achieving it, and then moving on to the next.
