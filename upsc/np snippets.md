Elaborating on the reasons, he added, “And the reason is that you (BJP) don’t consult people who have been in the field, who know what to say. The decisions are taken at the upper level, even in the Congress, the decisions were taken at the top level, but they used to consult us, everyone – MLAs, MPs’ views were taken.

Responding to a question does he misses Congress, Mr. Singh said “No, the system there was different, I miss the system. A broader type of consultation used to take place there (Congress) and there was a value of experience, which is lacking here (BJP). Congress is more flexible in taking views, the BJP, I find, is a bit rigid in its approach.”"
