Big Qs  fragment – reframe Q – select option

Probable causes of delay : Unclear Objectives , disorganized , inability to say NO , Interruptions , periods of inactivity

Stress and fatigue : all work and no play 

DNA : Disengage , negotiate and agree (Don’t force things on people) 

When \+ What \= Scchedule completion 

RBS – available and not available ( then go to mgmt.)pictorial format no email and writing 

Effort time ,idle time 

8 hrs – 1 hr lunch , 6 hr work , other meeting 

PERT , optimistic – risks reduced , no constraints , Most likely – dependencies on past experience Pessimistic – resource availability , resource productivity , all types of risks ( worst case scenario)

Less range , less risk 

Be real cool with statisitcs and scheduling and MS project move towards the median 

What best we can do , what worst can happen

Skill of discovering constraints 

**Top Manager and Sr Manager paid mode to handle constraints and Risks** 

Estimations affected by Perceptions and constraints 

40% of employees work on non critical activities in every company

Lack of resource availability (overstaying)

Make 2 schedule ( unlevelled and levelled ) – negotiate with mgmt. 

Fast tracking ( work more , cut requests )  more qs on fast tracking and crashing 

Create tolerances before creating a plan (max and min)

**Every Seller organization does bottom up estiamtion**

Estimates give range 

| Profit Margin |
| :---- |
| Fixed Costs and Overhead Costs |
| Risk Buffer |
| Direct Costs , variables Costs  |

Probability is the language of estimations

Total uncertainty – general uncertainty – specific uncertainty – total certainty 

Risk is uncertainity 

How to manage risks through people by taking decisions and actions

  * Beyond 10 yrs , its not your CV it is your ability to ‘perform’ on the job as a Manager that will help you to gain Promotion and move ahead  
  * Every 8-10 yrs , organization would like to shed / churn the workforce , so if you have been an engineer , transition to a PM/GM Role   
    * Your first 3 yeaars in the initial 10 yrs will be given to you , whether you look good bad or ugly and whether you are lousy or ambitious   
    * Next shift from TL to PM involves a transition period of 2 yrs , where you need to shed your technical skin and become comfy with ‘Project Management’ skill  
    * As a GM you need to be broad based strategic and highly efficient wrt Operations and Execution  
    * Nimbu nichodke kaam nikal wana hai sir engg se ( aggressive and authority)
