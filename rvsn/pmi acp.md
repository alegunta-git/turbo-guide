## PMI ACP Exam Questions {#pmi-acp-exam-questions}
* The Agile Manifesto was developed with Software Developers in the mind  
* If your Manager asks to start a project without a valid contract from the Customer – create an impact analysis of starting the project without the contract  
* Agile project deliver reliable results by enaging customers in frequent interactions and shared ownership  
* Process of defining abd documenting stakeholders needs to meet project objecitves is called collect requirements  
* Developing detailed description of project and product is called define scope   
* Middle of the project and the customer Is not happy with deliverables given last week – talk to the customer , u need to understand why the customer is not happy  
* Agile way of Product development – to produce working product early and incrementally   
* Change control process – PMs top priority first try preventing unncessary changes before trying other options   
* Agile projects boost perfirmance through group accountability for results and shared responsibioity for team effectiviness  
* Customer provides the SOW as part of bidding process  
* SOW \= Business need , Prouct scope description and Strategic plan ( not cost estimation)  
* Corrective action – documented direction for executing the project work to bring expected future performance of the project work in line with the PM plan  
* Preventive action – documented directions to perform an activity that can reduce the probability of negative consequences associated with project risks  
* Defect repair – recommendtion o repair the defect  
* Work performance information – deliveravle status , schedule progress , cost incurred   
* Project execution most of the budget is spent   
* Iteration retrospective is for the last completed iteration – so something new in each iteration  
* Middle of project and resource are not available –so make an impact plan on the project due to non availability of resources( wrong ans stopthe work  inform customer etc)  
* Integration is the key responsibility of PM   
*   
* Agile teams – 8 to 12 , cross functional and self organizing  
* Project communication management ( PM 90%) , distribute information  \- info available to stakeholders , stakeholder management strategy  \- increase the suport and minimize tge negative impacts of stakeholders ., WSR – formal written communication  informative workspace – give visibility ot the team

* scope boxed define the featurses dte uncertain and time boxed plans defines release date in advance, specific features uncertain   
* 10% iteration on technical debt  
* Stpries – customer value written in customer terminology , describe an end result customer values not implementation details , clear completion criteria , objective test for completion   
* Agile methods principles – customer involvement  incremental delivery , people not process  system is deigned for change  
* Empirical process – visibility , inspection anfd adaptation   
* User Stories  
  * Customer focused , domain experts write US , use the simplest tool (index card) , write in simple language ,   
  * include unique story number , include the priority number , include the estimated size   
  * INVEST – Independent , Negotiable , Valuable , Estimable , Sized properly , Testable   
* Epics , Features and User Stories   
  * Epics ( collections of features , 1-3 months in duration) , Features ( 2-4 weeks ) , US ( smallest increment of value , executed less than a week)

  * Time and Materials contract  
    * Suitable for agile , client pays for the hours – team members customer may seek a trial period of 6 months , customer trust the skill level / experience of vendor , review every 6 months , hike by 5% evert year
