## Warren Buffett
* Most people spend most of their time and effort earning money and hardly any time managing and growing it
* An investor without investment objectives is like a traveler without a destination
* Benjamin Franklin says: "An investment in knowledge pays the best interest".
* An investor needs to do very few things right, as long as he or she avoids big mistakes
* The enemy of investment is activity 
* Stressed people struggle to think about long term
* Risk come from not knowing what you are doing 
* Focus on the price of the company rather than price of the share Dividends don’t lie
* We read and think. Warren and I do more reading and thinking and less doing than most people in business. That is very uncommon –Charlie Munger
* If you took our top fifteen decisions out, we’d have a pretty average record. It wasn’t hyperactivity, but a hell of a lot of patience. You stuck to your principles and when opportunities came along, you pounced on them with vigor –Charlie Munger
