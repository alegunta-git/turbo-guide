## TVM 
**TVM Fx**
- PV (rate, nper, pmt, fv, type)
- FV , PV , Rate of Int % , Duration (N years) , PMT , 

**NPV ,Some points to note**
1. NPV is an absolute number
2. IRR is expressed in % terms
3. NPV calculates additional wealth
4. IRR reflects investment performance as well as cash flows
5. Use of IRR facilitates comparison
6. NPV and IRR both are discounted cash flow models
7. Since NPV is a direct measure of increase in wealth, NPV is preferred over IRR in case of conflict in mutually exclusive investments (where we have to select only one investment). In case of a scenario like: A’s NPV is high & B’s IRR is high, always go with the higher NPV option.

## Ratios
- Payback period = Initial investment amount/value ÷ Cash flow per year
- Payback period = Initial investment amount/value ÷ Cash flow per year
- Solvency ratio = Total assets / Total liabilities , Ideally, the ratio should be more than 1
- Liquidity Ratio = Total liquid assets/Total current debt , The value should be above one. 
- Liquidity Ratio = Total liquid assets\Total current debt , value of this ratio should ideally be above one. 
- Savings Ratio = Savings / Gross Income , target 20% savings rate,
- Debt to income r : Monthly Debt Payment / Monthly Income 15000(emi)/50000(sal) DTI : 30% , DTI < 30% ( to get a loan)
- HPR=(EV-BV/BV) *100
- Total return = (EV - BV)/ BV *100

**Inflation**
- Inflation : Future amount = Present amount * (1+inflation rate) ^number of years , = 10,000* (1+5%) ^10 = 16,289
- Purchasing Power , Future Value = Present value/(1+inflation rate)^number of years ,  =10,000/ (1+5%) ^10 = 6,139

**Compound Interest** 
- Formula: A = P * (1+r/t) ^ (nt) , Total amount you will receive after 10 years will be  = 1,00,000(1+0.1) ^10 = 2,59,374.25

**XIRR**
- XIRR (B14:B15,A14:a15) , 
- 01-Jan-2010 , -10000
- 01-Jan-2012 , 12000

**Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**
- indicate the return on an investment over a period. 
- best tool to compare returns of two different asset classes - for instance gold/equity or equity/real estate. 
- Formula:  CAGR=((FV/PV)^(1/n)) - 1
- Suppose that an investment of Rs 1,000 grows to Rs 5,000 in 10 years.
- CAGR is ((5,000/1,000)^(1/10)) - 1 , This comes to 17.4 per cent, 
- ((20,000/10,000) ^(1/2)) - 1, the CAGR comes to 41.42 per cent.

**Effective Annual Rate** 
- Formula: Effective Annual Rate = (1+(r/n))^n)-1*100
- If an investment is made at 9 per cent annual rate and compounding is done quarterly, 
- the effective annual rate will be (1+(0.09/4)^4) -1*100  = 9.3 per cent
- Inflation adjusted returns = [(1+ r) / (1+P)}-1]*100, where r is nominal , return and P is inflation rate
- Tax Adjusted returns TR = NR * (1-tax rate), where TR: tax adjusted return and NR: nominal return
- Post Tax Return ,  = Interest rate - (Interest rate*tax rate)  = 10-(10*30%) = 7


**Mutual Funds**
- Sharpe Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfolio volatility (v)
- Treynor Ratio (S) = (r (Portfolio return) – rf (Risk free rate)) / portfolio beta (b)
- Jensen Ratio (S) = R (actual portfolio return) – SML (expected return)
- SML= Rf+ ß (Rm- Rf), where Rf is risk free return, ß is portfolio beta , and Rm is market return.

**Future Value of SIP** 
- Formula: S = R((1+i)^n-1/i) (1+i)
- S = Future value of investment ,   R = Regular monthly investment  , i = Interest rate assumed /12
- n = Duration (number of months or number of years *12) investing Rs 1,000 each month for the next 10 years and expect a return of 15 per cent. Monthly over next 10 years = 12*10 = 120 months
- Interest: 15% per annum - 15/12 = 1.25% = 0.0125
- S = 1,000 * [{(1+ 0.0125) ^120 - 1}/0.0125] *  (1+ 0.0125)  = Rs 2,78,657, which is the future value of the SIP.


**How much we need** 
* Future cost= a* (1+r) ^ n | = 1200000 * ( 1+7% ) ^ 15 = 33 10 838  , 7 % inflation , 15 yr child edu, Current Val 12l
* How much to invest = PMT (RATE, NPER, PV, FV, Type) | = PMT( 12%/12 , 15.12 , 0 , 33 10 838)

**Loan EMI** 
- Formula: EMI= (A*R)*(1+R) ^N/ ((1+R) ^N)-1) ,  A = Loan amount ,  R = Interest rate N= Duration
- Suppose you have taken a loan of Rs 10 lakh at 11 per cent annual interest for 15 years.
- 1 per cent per annum translates into 11/1200 = 0.00916 per month , Tenure = 15*12 = 180 months
- EMI = (1000000 x 0.00916) x ((1+.00916) ^180) / ([(1+.00916) ^180] - 1)  = = Rs 11,361

**Loan(Home,Car)**
* EMI Formula: EMI= (A*R)*(1+R) ^N/ ((1+R) ^N)-1)
* loan 10l ,11%,15 years ,Tenure = 15*12 = 180 months , EMI = (1000000 x 0.00916)x((1+.00916)^180)/([(1+.00916) ^180] - 1)  = = Rs 11,361
