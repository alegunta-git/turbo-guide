## Awesome! Let’s build a **coding interview study plan** tailored to help you succeed—whether you're aiming for FAANG, startups, or product-based companies in India like Flipkart or Razorpay.

### 🗓️ 6-Week Coding Interview Prep Plan

- 💻 Practice: 10 DP problems

#### **Week 5: System Design & Behavioral Prep**
- ✅ Learn system design basics: scalability, caching, load balancing
- ✅ Prepare answers for behavioral questions using STAR method
- 📘 Read: *System Design Interview* by Alex Xu
- 💬 Practice mock interviews with a friend or mentor

#### **Week 6: Mock Interviews & Review**
- ✅ Simulate 2–3 full interviews (coding + behavioral)
- ✅ Review weak areas and revisit tough problems
- ✅ Polish resume and LinkedIn profile

---

### 🧠 Tips for Success
- Focus on **problem-solving patterns**, not memorizing solutions
- Track your progress with a spreadsheet or journal
- Use **whiteboard-style** practice to simulate real interviews
- Don’t neglect **communication skills**—they matter as much as code

## 12-Week DSA Learning Plan with Daily LeetCode Tasks
This plan builds your Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) mastery step-by-step, increasing difficulty and mixing theory with hands-on coding (especially LeetCode). Follow the daily schedule for consistent progress. Remember: Focus on quality over quantity, and reflect on each problem you solve.

How the Plan Works
Each week focuses on 1–2 core DSA topics.
Daily:
Study theory/review patterns (30–45 min).
Practice 2–3 LeetCode problems a day, based on the current topic (mix easy/medium, add hard by Week 5+).
End of week: Try a “review/mixed” session, revisiting hard problems or unsolved ones.
If stuck, discuss with peers or research approaches—don't just read solutions immediately.
Suggestion: Use a spreadsheet or Notion page to track problem numbers and difficulty.

How to Use This Plan Effectively
Try to code each solution yourself first. If you get stuck, use hints before reading solutions.
After solving, review what core pattern/concept was applied.
Keep a list of questions you found tough. Revisit them every 2–3 weeks.
By the end, attempt 5–10 varied mixed-topic LeetCode problems every weekend to simulate interviews.
