**Steve Jobs’ ‘strong message’ to engineers that remained Apple's guiding doctrine**

"Apple founder Steve Jobs once told the company engineers that the people who make real breakthroughs are not just thinkers, but also doers. In the early 1990s, Jobs addressed Apple engineers where he said “The doers are the major thinkers”, further citing Leonrado Da Vinci. He added “Did Leonardo have a guy off to the side thinking five years out what he would paint? Of course not. Leonardo was the artist, but he also mixed all his own paints.”"

## 80 20 Rule
* most popular 20 percent of products account for approximately 80 percent of sales;
* 20 percent of the largest customers also account for about 80 percent of sales;
* roughly 20 percent of sales account for 80 percent of profits. 
* 80 percent of wear and tear on your carpets will occur in only 20 percent of their area, 
* 20 percent of your clothes get worn 80 percent of the time.
* For the world wide web, 75/5 relationship: 5 percent of sites attracted 75 percent of visits; 
* For movies it is 80/1 (to the nearest round number): 1 percent of movies make 80 percent of the box office gross. 
* Shorthand notation : Sir Isaac Pitman invented shorthand after finding that just 700 words made up a staggering 70 percent of conversation. Including derivatives of these words, the Dictionary lists more than half a million words. fewer than 1 percent of words make up 80 percent of word usage. This pattern is very similar to that of the movies. 20% movies make 80% revenue

## Maths
* Fibonacci Series : "1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 …3rd no = sum of first two no's , Growth rate : 1.618 , 60%
* Formula for projection , x = f/ (1-f) , a typical S curve , contant - grow - plateau
* x = the factor by which to measure growth
* f = the percentage of the relevant population with the plague
* 1 – f = the percentage of the population not infected with the plague.
* Zipf’s rank/size rule (the size of American cities) 
* obey Zipf’s rank/size rule, the population of a city in any country is inversely proportional to its ranking. 
* second largest city would have half the popln of the largest; and 3rd  would have one third the people of the top city, and so on."


**Economics**
* Law of diminishing returns , 1767 , This law says that after a point, increases in effort or investment result in diminishing returns; that is, the incremental value declines. To a hungry woman, a loaf of bread has high value. ,The tenth may have very little value.
* "Simon’s theory of clumps and lumps : Why do cities organize themselves like this?  But one idea that Herbert Simon came up with nearly a half-century ago, which may well be right, is that whatever size cities start out, they will then attract to themselves a similar proportion of any subsequent increase in population. Each existing city is a ‘clump’ of whatever size. When population increases, it does so in ‘lumps,’ not just through the excess of new births over deaths, but through lumps of new arrivals (by immigration in the case of the US; in many other countries by people drifting from the countryside). But each new lump will tend to attach itself to a clump in proportion to the existing size of the lump. Simon explains this by the availability of employment, and by the observed fact that most entrepreneurs (who provide the employment) stay near where they started."

**N Narayana Murthy**
I observed how in a western country even the socialists understood that wealth has first to be created before it can be distributed; 
that there could only be a few leaders to create wealth. And that it’s the job of the government to create an environment

After admitting he uses ChatGPT, Narayana Murthy says management and technology graduates are same for him - India Today 

Different approaches, shared goals in problem-solving
The 78-year-old industry pioneer outlined the distinct yet interconnected roles each group plays in organisational success. "One asks 'what,' while the other focuses on 'how.' Technical people look at 'how,' and the management graduates look at 'what,'" he clarified, highlighting how both perspectives are essential for comprehensive problem-solving.

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary


**Elon Musk's 'wake-up call' for America echoes what brother Kimbal Musk said on Donald Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' - The Times of India**

Solar power in China will exceed ALL sources of electricity combined in the USA in 3 to 4 years. Wake up call,” Musk said in a post which showed data from Ember, a global energy think tank. Ember’s data chart suggests China's solar output hit 100 TWh in May 2025 and is doubling every two years, outpacing the US's 400

“We will need 25 new natural gas plants built per year to replace our amazingly successful solar and wind energy growth that this bill will kill,” he projected. Highlighting the urgency, he added, “Do the math. It takes 5-7 years to build a natural gas plant. The AI race will be won or lost in the next few years. Our energy grids are already collapsing.”

'Not a magnet for science...': Nobel laureate warns India can’t lure global talent, slams R&D woes - BusinessToday

"Neither the funding, the infrastructure, nor the general environment in India is attractive for top-level international scientists to leave the US to work in India,” he told The Hindu. While institutions like IISc, NCBS, TIFR, IISERs and IITs may offer potential, even they are “world class only in some very specific areas,” he pointed out."

He pointed to systemic issues that dissuade returning or relocating scientists: delayed research grants, inconsistent scholarship disbursals, and erratic policy changes. “If India is serious about attracting Indian scientists abroad to return, it needs to provide far better incentives,” he told The Hindu, citing China’s long-term strategy as a mode

According to industry experts, employers see an “MIT hire” as synonymous with analytical precision, technical prowess, and a solution-oriented mindset.”

**An economy allergic to failure': Tech CEO says UPSC is where India buries its ambition - BusinessToday**

"With its vast syllabus, unpredictable questions, and multi-stage eliminations, UPSC demands immense intellectual energy. But Singhal’s point is clear: that same energy could help power India’s next wave of innovation—if it weren’t stuck in exam halls.

“India doesn’t lack talent,” he concluded. “Its efforts are misplaced.”"


**Jennifer Allan, a 35-year-old realtor and content creator based in Delaware, told Newsweek that despite earning well, she had long struggled with financial management. “Not because I don’t make enough, but because I was never taught financial literacy,” she said**

"Seeking a change, she turned to ChatGPT for a 30-day personal finance challenge. Each day, she used the AI tool to suggest one actionable step toward reducing her debt, whether by brainstorming side hustles, cancelling unused subscriptions, or identifying unused funds in forgotten accounts.


The AI’s suggestions were simple but effective
One task prompted her to comb through finance apps and bank accounts, where she discovered over $10,000 ( ₹8.5 lakh) in unclaimed money, including in a dormant brokerage account. On another day, she created a pantry-only meal plan, reducing her monthly grocery bill by nearly ₹50,000.


Allan now plans to launch a second 30-day challenge to eliminate the rest. “It wasn’t some big financial hack,” she said. “It was the act of facing it every day, of tracking it, talking about it, looking at it. I stopped being afraid of my numbers.”

**What are some important, but uncomfortable truths that many people learn when transitioning into adulthood?**
- Every person is responsible for their own happiness -- not their parents, not their boss, not their spouse, not their friends, not their government, not their deity.
- Practically all of the best opportunities (in business, in romance, etc) are only offered to people who already have more than they need.
- The idea that you will be happy after you make X amount of dollars is almost certainly an illusion., The idea that you will be happy after you meet [some amazing person] is almost certainly an illusion.
- When you don't possess leverage (go look up "BATNA"), people will take advantage of you, whether they mean to or not.
- Almost everybody is making it up as they go along. Also, many (most?) people are incompetent at their jobs.
- When talking about their background and accomplishments, almost everybody is continually overstating their abilities, impact, relevance, and contributions.
- Very few people will ever give you 100% candid, honest feedback.
- Certain people -- some of whom are in positions of enormous power -- just do not give a damn about other human beings.

- Learn how to make a simple line graph in something other than Excel. Make sure you can do it right (same requirements).
- Get your eclipse installation fully pumped up: python dev tools, c dev tools, any other language you could ever write in, and make sure you can write a hello world successfully in each perspective. It'll save you time some future day.
- Learn the basic functionality of a NoSQL database; (you can learn a big chunk of mongoDB in a day)
- Learn the most basic functionality of SQL (you don't need to be a query guru,  but have a small clue about it).
- Learn a tool for in-depth parsing of HTML and XML
- Implement a list-of-lists graph data structure
- Implement random walk, PageRank, clustering coefficient finding (#triangles over possible triangles) and common neighbor number finding.
- Implement BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, topological sort and Minimum Spanning Tree (bonus for union-find version). Take a couple days if you have no algorithms background.

**Self-Discipline: How to Develop Spartan Discipline, Unbreakable Mental Toughness, and Relentless Willpower** 
- Spartan Minimalism , “Luxury dilutes hunger.”— Robin Sharma
- “Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.”— Henry David Thoreau “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”— Leonardo da Vinci
- Having a cold shower requires no discipline for he who has no hot water system.
- Being frugal requires no discipline for he who has no money.
- The Spartan’s achieved discipline not through the exertion of willpower but through the development of laser-like focus.
- Simplicity breeds success. Keeping things minimal in nonessential areas of life makes room for massive achievement in the areas of life that you have decided are most important.
- Toughen Up , The Spartans knew that full bellies don’t plow fields.
- Back in the late 1990s, Apple was in the exact same situation—financially speaking. They were backed into a corner with no way out. So what they did was discontinue the majority of their products and pretty much start from scratch.
- Their disciplined way of life ensured, no matter how great their successes, they would always be “lean and hungry”—
- Rather, strength is—according to Navy SEAL instructors—90 percent mental and only 10 percent physical.
- Spartans Had a ‘Why’ That Enabled Them to Endure Almost Any ‘How’ , “He who has a ‘why’ to live can bear almost any ‘how’.”— Friedrich Nietzsche
