**N Narayana Murthy**
I observed how in a western country even the socialists understood that wealth has first to be created before it can be distributed; 
that there could only be a few leaders to create wealth. And that it’s the job of the government to create an environment

**Decisions are temporary**
"But what if ...?" "What happens when ...?" "Don't we need to plan for ...?"  
Don't make up problems you don't have yet. It's not a problem until it's a real problem. Most of the things you worry about never happen anyway. 
Besides, the decisions you make today don't need to last forever. It's easy to shoot  down good ideas, interesting policies, or worthwhile experiments by assuming that whatever you decide now needs to work for years on end.
It's just not so, especially for a small business. If circumstances change, your decisions can change. Decisions are temporary

**What are some important, but uncomfortable truths that many people learn when transitioning into adulthood?**
- Every person is responsible for their own happiness -- not their parents, not their boss, not their spouse, not their friends, not their government, not their deity.
- Practically all of the best opportunities (in business, in romance, etc) are only offered to people who already have more than they need.
- The idea that you will be happy after you make X amount of dollars is almost certainly an illusion., The idea that you will be happy after you meet [some amazing person] is almost certainly an illusion.
- When you don't possess leverage (go look up "BATNA"), people will take advantage of you, whether they mean to or not.
- Almost everybody is making it up as they go along. Also, many (most?) people are incompetent at their jobs.
- When talking about their background and accomplishments, almost everybody is continually overstating their abilities, impact, relevance, and contributions.
- Very few people will ever give you 100% candid, honest feedback.
- Certain people -- some of whom are in positions of enormous power -- just do not give a damn about other human beings.

**What are some useful computer related technical skills I can learn within a day?**
- Learn how to use Git and GitHub
- Learn how to use SVN
- Learn simple linux regular expressions
- Find a site with a few interview programming questions, and practice going through the full answer, with code, for some of them (a few a day should be good; do them in a language you don't know well if you already can ace most).
- Set up a crawler that can scrape some webpages and parse some basic data.
- Set up a bigger crawler that has to fill out a form or two.
- Program a basic linear algebra library (matrices, vectors, multiplication)
- Add SVD to this library , Add matrix inversion to this library
- Add least squares regression to this library
- Make your library work efficiently with sparse data.
- Learn how to use list comprehensions in python.
-  Read the freaking manual for your favorite language. In the past I've wasted hours in Python because I didn't know that the Counter data structure existed, and kept getting the bugs from using Dicts as Counters. There are many examples like this.
- Get a stackoverflow account and learn to use the site. If you don't at least know that StackOverflow is an available resource, and you're an english-speaking programmer, you're doing it wrong.
- Implement a simple Machine learning algorithm on your own, with a whole pipeline. I.e. you read a simple input csv, split it into training and test set, run a simple algorithm with readily-tuneable or explorable hyperparameters, and a simple output of relevant statistics.
- Learn the how to make a simple line graph in Excel, and make sure you can do it right; i.e. properly labeled axes and tick marks, title and legends.
- Learn how to make a simple line graph in something other than Excel. Make sure you can do it right (same requirements).
- Get your eclipse installation fully pumped up: python dev tools, c dev tools, any other language you could ever write in, and make sure you can write a hello world successfully in each perspective. It'll save you time some future day.
- Learn the basic functionality of a NoSQL database; (you can learn a big chunk of mongoDB in a day)
- Learn the most basic functionality of SQL (you don't need to be a query guru,  but have a small clue about it).
- Learn a tool for in-depth parsing of HTML and XML
- Implement a list-of-lists graph data structure
- Implement random walk, PageRank, clustering coefficient finding (#triangles over possible triangles) and common neighbor number finding.
- Implement BFS, DFS, Shortest Path, topological sort and Minimum Spanning Tree (bonus for union-find version). Take a couple days if you have no algorithms background.
- Make a simple java applet that has at least some interaction with listeners and not just buttons and such.

**Self-Discipline: How to Develop Spartan Discipline, Unbreakable Mental Toughness, and Relentless Willpower** 
- Spartan Minimalism , “Luxury dilutes hunger.”— Robin Sharma
- “Our life is frittered away by detail. Simplify, simplify.”— Henry David Thoreau “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.”— Leonardo da Vinci
- Having a cold shower requires no discipline for he who has no hot water system.
- Being frugal requires no discipline for he who has no money.
- The Spartan’s achieved discipline not through the exertion of willpower but through the development of laser-like focus.
- Simplicity breeds success. Keeping things minimal in nonessential areas of life makes room for massive achievement in the areas of life that you have decided are most important.
- Toughen Up , The Spartans knew that full bellies don’t plow fields.
- Back in the late 1990s, Apple was in the exact same situation—financially speaking. They were backed into a corner with no way out. So what they did was discontinue the majority of their products and pretty much start from scratch.
- Their disciplined way of life ensured, no matter how great their successes, they would always be “lean and hungry”—
- Rather, strength is—according to Navy SEAL instructors—90 percent mental and only 10 percent physical.
